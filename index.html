              <td>Ancient Domains of Mystery (ADOM for short) is a rogue-like game which means that it is a single-user game featuring the exploration of a dungeon complex.  You control a fictional character described by race, class, attributes, skills, and equipment.  This fictional character is trying to achieve a specific goal (see below) and succeed in a difficult quest.  To fulfill the quest, you have to explore previously undiscovered tunnels and dungeons, fight hideous monsters, uncover long forgotten secrets, and find treasures of all kind.

During the game, you explore dungeon levels which are randomly generated each game.  You might also encounter certain special levels, which present a particular challenge or are built around a certain theme.

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> If you are a first-time player you should read the 'How to start' section of this manual.

    <h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Guidebook Introduction</h3>
    This guidebook is intended to be a definitive single-file reference for ADOM and as such contains many spoilers. There is no provision made to protect newer players from spoilers, so if you want to figure out the game for yourself, this guide is not
    appropriate. Both the original <a href="http://www.adomgb.info">Original Guidebook</a> and the <a href="http://adomgb.sweb.cz">Improved Guidebook</a> were designed so that the content of the <a href="adomman-toc.html">ADOM Manual</a> would (mostly) not be repeated. This Single-file Improved Adom Guidebook, however, will eventually merge the manual information with the ones in here so that it can actually be used as a single source.
    As a huge ammount of information (dozens of thousands of html lines) are still exactly as they were on either of the above mentioned sources, if you want to know about the history of the guidebook making you should visit each one of those.
    Eventually this guidebool will have a history of its own to tell.
    Most of the information is relative do ADOM versions prior to 1.2, but eventually pieces of information will be updated as possible.
    By hosting this project on github this guidebook aims to become a collaborative effort from the community to keep and update a solid reference to this game that we all love and play so much.

    <p> There are of course Ancardian day and date effects as well,
      which are well covered in the <a
        href="adomman-B.html#B1">ADOM
        Manual</a>. One Ancardian time effect not mentioned is the fact
      that the PC's range of sight depends on the time of day on the
      overworld map and in the wilderness. During the day (which
      apparently begins around 6h), the PC sees further, and at night
      (which apparently begins around 20h) the PC's sight is limited to
      2 squares on the overworld map, 5 in the wilderness. Terrain,
      Perception score, whether or not using lit torch(es), necklace of
      the eye, and the Farsight spell all contribute to the sight range.</p>
    <p> Press <tt>@</tt> or <tt>Ctrl-e</tt> to learn Ancardian month,
      day, and time. You start the game at day 1 of Unicorn, at
      midnight.</p>

    <h4>0.1.2 Birth </h4>
    <a name="0.1.2.1"></a>
    <h4>0.1.2.1 Star sign</h4>
    Check out the <a
      href="adomman-B.html#B2">ADOM Manual</a>
    for general game-related effect of starsigns. Additional tips are
    provided here.
    <ol type="A">
      <li>Raven
        <p> The +10 to Speed is good for all PCs. It can save the life
          of low level PCs who need to run away from a monster they
          can't handle. The "messengers will reach you faster" refers to
          the delivery of the rune-covered trident, which happens faster
          for those born in this month, at level 16 rather than 36, a
          nice bonus. The "harder to trick by deceptions" grants
          resistance to confusion attacks by dopplegangers. The stronger
          companions characteristic makes this month excellent for <b>Bards</b>.
          The Raven birthsign gives you a 75% chance to evade a
          doppleganger's confusion attack.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>Book
        <p> Lawful tendencies is a weak effect. One free skill increase
          each level helps all PCs, especially those with low learning.
          Increased chance to learn spells means borderline casters have
          a better chance. This is not the ideal month for a Wizard -
          they are already great at learning spells. More suited to <b>elven
            fighting classes</b> or a <b>Dwarvish Paladin</b>. The Book
          birthsign decreases alignment changes towards chaotic by 10%.
          Book-born characters get an undocumented +3 boost to Learning.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>Wand
        <p> Here we have the sign for a <b>neutral Wizard</b>. Gray
          Elven Wizards are ideal with their naturally high Mana and
          neutral alignment. They are somewhat difficult to keep alive
          in the early game but become enormously powerful in the mid-
          and endgame. The Wand birthsign decreases alignment changes
          towards chaotic by 10%.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>Unicorn
        <p> Generic sign with resistance to corruption. Pretty
          attractive for any PC going for an ultra ending, especially an
          aspiring <b>Avatar of Order</b>. The fact that lawful
          alignment is difficult to change means such a PC can commit a
          few chaotic acts and get away with it without becoming a
          fallen champion. Also nice for an aspiring (ultimate) <b>Chaos
            God</b>, since crowned chaotics are corrupted more rapidly
          than others. The Unicorn birthsign reduces corruption by 19%
          if you are L, by 37% if L+, and increases it by 30% for C-.
          Due to a bug, it also increases alignment changes towards
          chaotic by 20%.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>Salamander
        <p> Very attractive for <b>Elementalists</b>, who rely on a lot
          of fire magic. Not half bad for a <b>Necromancer</b> who
          finds some fire-based spellbooks, either. Necromancers need
          that +3 to Mana.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>Dragon
        <p> <b>Fighters</b>. The +1 to Toughness is not significant -
          that is within the variability for the attribute for identical
          race/class PCs. The -3 to Willpower is significant and makes
          this unattractive for those who need it in the early game -
          Wizards, Mindcrafters. Not a bad month for <b>Paladins</b>
          with both weapon and combat magic costs reduced.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>Sword
        <p> Learning bonus is insignificant, although it can push a PC
          from illiterate to literate. The 20% reduction in cost to
          train melee weapon skills makes this attractive for a PC that
          really wants to become super-proficient with a weapon. Not a
          bad choice for <b>Rangers</b> who start the game dual
          wielding swords.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>Falcon
        <p> Grants the Survival skill to any character. This skill is
          generally considered as being of little use (see section <a
            "#0.4"="">0.4</a>). The Willpower bonus is somewhat useful
          for spellcasters and <b>Mindcrafters</b>, although better
          starsigns exist for those classes. The Charisma bonus is of
          little significance for any character, with the possible
          exception of <b>Bards, Necromancers and male Merchants</b>.
          The free talent is good for all PCs, especially for gnomish
          and hurthling Bards, as it guarantees them both a very useful
          Heir gift and the possibility to go for the Treasure Hunter
          talent.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>Cup
        <p> Another sign for <b>Wizards</b>. Higher Learning to start
          and the 10% reduction to gain a level means they advance
          rapidly, which is very helpful in keeping them alive at low
          level. The 20% effectivity increase in learning spells also
          helps keep them alive in the early game, while the player has
          not had time to raise their Learning score.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>Candle
        <p> This can be an unbelievable sign for <b>Trolls</b>. They
          heal rapidly anyway, but those born in this month almost don't
          need the Healing skill! Almost. Get it and they seem to have
          natural regeneration. Playing a <b>trollish Healer</b> born
          in this month is almost cheating. ;-) Candle-born characters
          are guaranteed to heal 2 hitpoints every 12 turns.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>Wolf
        <p> Significant benefits to Perception and Willpower. The
          Willpower is good for <b>Wizards</b> and <b>Mindcrafters</b>,
          of course. Races that start with lower Perception include <b>Dwarves,
            Orcs</b> and of course <b>Trolls</b>.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>Tree
        <p> Made for <b>Mindcrafters</b>, who really need that +5 to
          Willpower in the early game. Not bad for <b>Wizards</b>
          either. The Tree birthsign reduces all alignment changes by
          10%.<br>
          <small> As of v1.2.0, Tree also gets +2 To and +1 PV.</small></p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p> The Candle starsign is by far the best for any character, with
      Raven being the distant second. The Candle healing effect is great
      for everyone and it is better than the Healing skill at 100.
      Raven's speed bonus allows all characters to outrun most
      opponents. The effects of other starsigns are utterly negligible
      when compared to Raven and especially Candle.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.1.2.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.1.2.2 Special birth messages</h4>
    If you are really lucky, one of these messages could be generated
    along with the star sign.
    <ul>
      <li>The night you were born....<br>
        ...the local undead were seen packing up and moving away.<br>
        It means that your character will gain (or is born with?) the
        "natural enemy of undead" intrinsic. This makes undead flee from
        you periodically. This also means you always slay undead in
        melee - same effect as !Unde weapons.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>...your long lost brother showed up.<br>
        Greater chance of special locations generated in dungeons
        (hives, shops, pools, etc).
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>...a two headed calf was born.<br>
        10% less experience points are required for an experience level
        increase.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>...a falling star killed the village elder.<br>
        10% less experience points are required for an experience level
        increase.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.1.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.1.3 Sex</h4>
    The sex of the character has little significance. The following
    table lists all known gameplay differences.

    <h4>0.1.4 Race and class</h4>
    A list of the races and classes can be found in the <a
      href="adomman-C.html">ADOM Manual</a>.
    It also gives a bit of background about each, much of which is
    flavor and irrelevant in terms of gameplay.
    <p> <a name="0.1.4.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.1.4.1 Specific starting trained skills and alignment</h4>
    Each race has unique characteristics including initial alignment,
    trained skills and modifiers to attributes. Skills in ADOM vary in
    terms of availability. All PCs are born with Climbing [1dDx + 1d10 +
    20], First Aid [1dLe + 1d10 + 15], Haggling [1dCh + 1d10 + 15], and
    Listening [1dPe + 1d10 + 20]. All PCs other than Beastfighters and
    Barbarians with a Learning score of 10 or greater are born with
    Literacy [Le*4]. Many skills can be taught or trained by various
    NPCs during the game. Other skills are much more difficult to obtain
    if the PC is not born with them. Skills other than Alertness and
    Healing can be wished for. Any skill can be obtained from a potion
    of education, but this is a matter of random chance and cannot be
    counted on. Skills available only from wishes or potions of
    education are referred to as "Nonguaranteed Skills" for the sake of
    the tables below. The first table shows the starting alignment and
    trained skills [starting value] that each race is born with. For all
    starting values, please consider 1dx as 1dx-1, ie generating a
    random number between 0 and x-1. So 1d5+5 means a value between 5
    and 9. Consider ydx (y &gt; 1) normally.

    <p> Falcon birthsign increases Survival by 10, or grants Survival at
      10 if there was no Survival by race or class.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.1.4.1.3"></a> The manual also states that Bards get
      more skills than other classes. Testing does not agree with this.
      What the manual fails to mention is the two free skill advances
      per level Bards receive. This is useful for races that have low
      initial Learning scores, such as Orcs and Trolls.</p>
    <p> There are definite effects on gameplay depending on the
      alignment, skills and birthsign the PC is born with. Note that
      none of the races is born with the Healing skill; it is entirely
      class-dependent. Nine classes are born with Healing. It is
      essential to obtain this skill (except for those born under
      Candle). This means that those without it <i>must</i> choose
      Rynt's quest as opposed to Guth'Alak's in Terinyo, whether they
      intend to actually obtain the skill from Jharod or Kranf Niest.
      This puts restrictions on the game right away, since the Keethrax
      quest and thus a guaranteed artifact and potion of cure corruption
      are forfeited before the game even starts. Further, three races
      start with chaotic alignment. If the PC wants to receive Healing
      from Jharod, thus avoiding Kranf Niest's attribute drains,
      alignment must be changed to neutral (or lawful).</p>
    <p> Note also that no race starts with Herbalism, the other skill
      available through a Terinyo quest. If the player wants maximum
      flexibility - to do either Rynt's or Guth'Alak's quest, or neither
      (in the case of a minimalist challenge game) - choose a class that
      starts with Healing, Herbalism, or ideally both, such as a
      Beastfighter, Druid, Healer, Priest, Ranger or Wizard.</p>
    <p> If there is a skill that is difficult to obtain that you cannot
      live without, such as Alertness, play a Dark Elf or Drakeling, or
      choose a class that is born with it - Archers, Healers, Monks,
      Rangers and Thieves all start with this skill. Many players feel
      similarly about Detect Item Status - play Priests or a Merchant
      for a challenge.</p>
    <p> A PC that trains a given skill due to both race and class will
      be especially proficient with that skill. This makes certain
      combinations especially powerful. Dwarven Weaponsmiths (doubly
      trained Metallurgy and Smithing), Hurthling Archers (doubly
      trained Archery), Hurthling Farmers (doubly trained Archery,
      Cooking, Food Preservation, Gardening, Stealth) and Dark Elven
      Rangers (doubly trained Alertness and Climbing) are examples.</p>

    <p> [4] Shadow Touch will regain HP first; if maxed, it will regain
      PP instead. PP Gained is DamageDealt / 2, HP Gained is DamageDealt
      / 3. There is DamageDealt/1000 chance to get +1 Mana. If 1d10000-1
      &lt; damage dealt, you gain 1 Mana.</p>
    <p> [5] Also receives only 1/3 of drowning damage.</p>
    <p> [6] Melting ability is determined by the weight of what you're
      melting down as far as how many ingots you'll get. This means for
      example ultra-heavy armors are especially nice for melting down.
      Blessed hammer + blessed metal = 9:1000 (9 ingots for 1000
      stones); B+U = 8,1:1000; B+C = 6,3:1000; U+U = 7,2:1000; U+C =

    <p> <a name="0.1.4.3.3"></a>Higher Xp number means more experience
      is required to advance a level.</p>
    <p> The <a href="adomman-C.html#C2">ADOM
        Manual</a> gives some hints about race/class combinations. For
      instance, the manual identifies Trolls as the strongest, toughest
      and stupidest race in the game and suggests that they make good
      fighters (because of their Strength and Toughness) and lousy
      magicians (because of their low Learning and Mana). This is true
      as far as it goes, but Trollish Wizards can be a viable
      combination if they are played more as fighters to start and later
      develop their magical talents. Elves make fantastic Wizards (due
      to their high Learning and Mana) once they gain some experience,
      but are difficult to keep alive in the early game because of their
      low Toughness. Humans are a jack of all trades race and can be
      used with all classes. Some combinations favored by newsgroup
      readers: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Trollish Beastfighters and Barbarians</b> - brute force
        fighters </li>
      <li><b>Gnomish Elementalists</b> - magic users with more Toughness
        than elves </li>
      <li><b>Elven Archers</b> - natural talent with bows </li>
      <li><b>Elven Wizards</b> - high Mana and Learning </li>
      <li><b>Dwarven Weaponsmiths</b> - natural smithing talent </li>
      <li><b>Hurthling Archers</b> - natural talent with thrown rocks </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Classes and combinations that are regarded as difficult: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Farmers</b> </li>
      <li><b>Merchants</b>, especially Dark Elven Merchants because of
        their low Charisma and Toughness </li>
      <li><b>Necromancers</b> in general are very difficult to keep
        alive at low levels </li>

    <p> Press <tt>B</tt> to determine your age and age category. You
      can start the game as either young or grownup. The age category
      has definite effects on your attribute scores, listed in the
      effects fields. Generally, you lose Strength, Toughness,
      Appearance, and Perception with age. On the other hand, you gain
      Learning, Willpower, and Mana. During normal game, you naturally
      age very slowly, and this should almost never become any problem.
      However, undead attacks may unnaturally change your age and age
      category very quickly, depending on race. Use potions of youth to
      reverse the effects of unnatural aging. Potions of longevity
      increase your max age. Beware of cursed potions of youth and
      longevity though - they may result in an immediate death of old
      age.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.1.4.5"></a></p>
    <h4>0.1.4.5 Special considerations</h4>
    <b>Dark Elves</b> - Dark Elves receive very low offers and high
    prices in Waldenbrook's Dwarftown shop. Dark Elven Necromancers are
    very Chaotic. It takes some work to get them to Neutral alignment to
    receive Healing from Jharod, for instance, if that is desired. Dark
    Elves are unique in that spider corpses are nutritious for them.
    Poison resistance can still be gained from spider corpses. Also, if
    a Dark Elven PC is caught in a web and covered by "hundreds of tiny
    spiders", he/she won't be bitten and thus won't get poisoned
    (instead, the message "You welcome your spidery friends." is
    generated after the spiders swarm). Unlike most other races, Dark
    Elves' line of sight increases in the nighttime and decreases during
    the daytime.
    <p> <b>Drakelings</b> - Drakelings face special problems in the
      ToEF (see section <a href="#2.5">2.5</a>) and D: 49 (see
      section <a "#3.23"="">3.23</a>). Drakelings who are unlucky
      enough to find a greater white dragon vault will also face speed
      problems. Drakelings have a unique racial acid spit - press <tt>m</tt>
      to use it - which does Max(2,Level/3)d6+(Level/2) damage, has
      Max(2, St/4) range, hits target if 1d(Level+10)+Dx &gt;
      MonstersDV+3, and consumes 5d10+50 food points per spit.</p>
    <p> <b>Dwarves</b> - Dwarves have unique access to the Mithril skin
      talent (+3 PV), and they find secret doors quicker. Also, they are
      more likely to receive the Rolf's Saviour artifact, and they can
      read runes on Griff Bloodax's grave.</p>
    <p> <b>Humans</b> - No known inherent racial abilities.</p>
    <p> <b>Hurthlings</b> - Hurthlings start the game with the Thrown
      Rocks missile weapon skill at level four. They also start the game
      wearing a cursed ring, unfortunately. Hurthlings also have a
      racial dislike for shoes, which causes a loss of Dexterity when
      Hurthlings use footwear in ADOM. Hurthlings also have an advantage
      over other races when training the slings and thrown rocks missile
      weapon skills: they require only two thirds of the marks other
      races do in order to advance a skill level.</p>
    <p> <b>Elves</b> - All elves, High, Gray, or Dark, have very long
      lifespans. This is worth considering since several of the high
      level monsters encountered in ADOM have an aging attack. Ghost
      Lords, for instance, may well age a Human or Troll to death in one
      or two hits, since these PCs have a life span of 100 years or so
      at most. Elven PCs do not need to worry about this, since they
      live for about 1000 years. Balancing this is the fact that they
      are more fragile than other races in terms of Toughness in the
      early game.</p>
    <p> <b>Gnomes</b> - Gnomes require only 3/4 the number of missile
      weapon marks to advance their crossbow skill level relative to
      other races.</p>
    <p> <b>Orcs</b> - Like Dark Elves, Orcs receive very low offers and
      high prices in Waldenbrook's Dwarftown shop. Orcs have a short
      lifespan relative to other races. Unlike most other races, Orcs'
      line of sight increases in the nighttime and decreases during the
      daytime.</p>
    <p> <b>Trolls</b> - Trools need about double the amount of food
      compared to other races. They advance in experience level very
      slowly relative to other races. Trolls start the game with the
      Twohanded Weapons melee skill at level two. Do not pay any
      attention to this if you are playing a trollish Beastfighter. Drop
      that club and fight unarmed.</p>
    <p> <b>Archers</b> - Archers find more ammunition and start at
      skill level 1 for their starting missile weapon.</p>
    <p> <b>Assassins</b> - First Alchemy recipe is always for potion of
      poison. Assassins can receive the Filk quest as soon as level 30.</p>
    <p> <b>Barbarians</b> and <b>Beastfighters</b> - With the
      exception of Elves, they start illiterate. They also face huge
      difficulties learning spells.</p>
    <p> <b>Bards</b> - Bards have an advantage when using Music; their
      chances for taming/calming down monsters is higher than other
      classes. Also, pets won't turn on a Bard upon triggering traps on
      them. Moreover, Bards will find more variation in item modifiers:
      to-hit/to-damage boni in weapons/missiles and DV/PV boni in armor.</p>
    <p> <b>Druids</b> - All Druids start at neutral zero alignment, and
      get spellbook of Lightning Bolt. Non-summoned animals are neutral
      towards Druids (including cats). Bugs in the bug-infested temple
      are not included. Druids need 50% more marks to increase a weapon
      skills. They get a different reward for completing the Druid
      quest.</p>
    <p> <b>Farmers</b> - Farmers start the game with a large dog pet,
      level two in Polearms weapon skill and require 20% less marks to
      increase their Polearms level.</p>
    <p> <b>Fighters</b> - No known inherent class abilities.</p>
    <p> <b>Healers</b> - The number of turns usually required for
      natural HP regeneration is halved for Healers. They do not spend
      any turns whilst using a stethoscope.</p>
    <p> <b>Merchants</b> - Merchants always specialize in a certain
      item: potions, rings, scrolls, or wands. This specialization
      allows them to identify any item in that category on sight.
      Merchants have the ability to use thrown gold pieces as effective
      missiles. Dopplegangers are not able to deflect gold pieces thrown
      by Merchants. This is the only known way to attack dopplegangers
      with missiles. Merchants also receive better shop prices, the
      exception is Terinyo shop. They also find more shops.</p>
    <p> <b>Monks</b> - Monks are expert kickers. They start off with a
      base damage of 1d10 to kicking, which increases as they gain
      levels - but lose the bonuses if burdened or worse. They cannot
      injure themselves by kicking the air. Their food consumption is
      about half the rate of other classes. Monks do not lose Mana when
      writing scrolls. They start with no gold, except when picking the
      "Wealthy" talents.</p>
    <p> <b>Mindcrafters</b> - Mindcrafters possess really unique
      Mindcraft abilities no other class can ever obtain. The <tt>Ctrl-i</tt>
      command is used to invoke Mindcraft. More on the Mindcraft
      abilities in section <a href="#0.5.3">0.5.3</a>.
      Mindcrafters have extremely hard time learning spells from books.</p>
    <p> <b>Necromancers</b> - The manual states that level 50
      Necromancers can return from the dead if their Toughness is
      greater than 10. It goes on to say that they lose one-half of
      their Toughness when this happens. It does not mention that if
      their equipment keeps their Toughness at 10 or more, they can do
      this indefinitely. Necromancers suffer from low dice modifiers on
      their skills, finding difficulties to advance Concentration,
      limited by a 1d3 or 1d5 modifier. Of equal importance for
      Necromancers is Food Preservation, similarly limited. In contrast,
      Rangers, Bards and Beastfighters can expect very high 4d5
      modifiers on most of their skills. Necromancers also need 100%
      more marks to increase weapon skills. Like Wizards, Necromancers
      find all spells (including Wish) in the Library. Finally, they can
      perform Necromancy very efficiently - see <a href="#0.11.6">0.11.6</a>.</p>
    <p> <b>Paladins</b> and <b>Priests</b> cannot use their class
      powers if they do not have enough piety with their deity. They
      also find more spellbooks. Priests need 50% more marks to increase
      weapon skills. Paladins do double damage with Justifier.</p>
    <p> <b>Rangers</b> - Rangers do not receive the -6 penalty to-hit
      on each weapon when fighting with two weapons, like other classes
      do.</p>
    <p> <b>Thieves</b> - Along with Dark Elves, Orcs, and Dwarves,
      Thieves have easier time finding secret doors.</p>
    <p> <b>Weaponsmiths</b> - Your PC can never start out burdened -
      Strength will be raised enough so that the PC can handle the
      weight. Weaponsmiths start with a very heavy 1000s anvil; this can
      give weaker races, like Hurthlings, a large, free Strength boost.
      Weaponsmiths of course have easier time Smithing - see section <a
        href="#0.15.4">0.15.4</a> for details.</p>
    <p> <b>Wizards</b> - Wizards born under the Salamander birthsign
      always start with spellbook of Fire Bolt. Wizards have easier time
      writing scrolls. They find more spellbooks than other classes, and
      they find all spellbokks in the Library, including Wish. On the
      negative side, Wizards require twice as many weapon marks to
      advance weapon skill levels.</p>
    <p> <b>Beastfighters</b> and <b>Monks</b> increase their Speed,
      DV, to-hit and damage with level. Beastfighters lose their bonuses
      if using weapons. Monks get no bonuses if Burdened or worse,
      wearing a shield, or an armor other than robe, black robe, clean
      robe, clothes, elven chain mail, Shirt of the Saints, Robes of
      Resistance. The Speed bonus for both classes is lvl/2, to-hit
      bonus is lvl*2 + lvl/3 - (lvl-1)/5 - 1. Beastfighter's damage is
      1d(4+lvl/3*2) + lvl/2+lvl/4, Monk's damage is 1d(8+lvl) + lvl/4.
      Beastfighters get +1 DV every third level, Monks get +1 DV in two
      levels out of three. Monks get also bonuses to kicking if not
      wielding weapons (they start with 1d10). </p>

    Four paragraphs describe PC's history (or <tt>B</tt>ackground):
    information about parents, childhood, youthhood, and young
    adulthood. All of these are pretty random and have little
    significance - different descriptions probably modify slightly
    starting attributes. Additional research is needed on this topic.

As you make your way toward the chain of mountains you have heard so much about, you stop for the evening at a village inn. Everyone gathers for the evening meal and you overhear a conversation between two seemingly well-to-do merchants. They are talking about a collection of precious jewelry which has been entrusted to them by an evil dark elven master assassin named Magrak.

    <h4>0.1.8 Name</h4>
    Of course, you can choose the PC's name freely, and you can also
    rename the PC later using the <tt>n</tt>ame command. You may as
    well let the game select a name for the PC, if you just press Enter
    to the game prompt, but only if Allow_Default_Names is set to true,
    that is. Otherwise you are required to enter a name! The monster
    memory remembers PC's name and provides verbal descriptions of
    his/her current experience level, attributes except Perception, and
    DV/PV values.

    <h3>0.2 Religion</h3>
    Religion in ADOM means the PC has an alignment score which
    determines their current deity, and three piety scores. Furthermore,
    altars and tracts are randomly generated, and commands for
    sacrificing - <tt>O</tt>, praying - <tt>_</tt>, and displaying
    your current <tt>:g</tt>od exist.
    <p> <a name="0.2.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.1 Alignment</h4>
    Alignment reflects the moral nature of the PC. For example, PCs with
    lawful alignment generally do not slaughter innocents or steal from
    shops. Chaotic PCs will do these things and a lot worse besides.
    Neutral PCs choose from both options, doing nasty things when
    necessary to further their cause, but also performing good acts to
    maintain their balanced alignment.
    <p> A general and quite complete description of alignment can be
      found in the <a
        href="adomman-D.html#D1">ADOM
        Manual</a>. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with that
      description. The effects alignment have on gameplay are discussed
      here. The effects are mostly evident to the player in terms of the
      quests and rewards that are available.</p>

    <h4>0.2.1.2 Alignment range</h4>
    Alignment can range from -10000 to +6000 as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>C-: -10000 to -5000 </li>
      <li>C : -4999 to -1251 </li>
      <li>CN: -1250 to -1000 </li>

      <li>L+: +5000 to +6000 </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.2.1.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.1.3 Chaotic acts</h4>
    Changing alignment can be done in several ways. It is easy to change
    from a lawful flavor of alignment to a chaotic one. The PC need only
    commit chaotic acts, which include the following:
    <p> <b>Repeatable chaotic acts</b> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>attacking non-hostile monsters, especially innocent ones
        (children, the Cute Dog) </li>
      <li>killing lawful monsters, such as blink dogs or white unicorns,
        even when hostile </li>
      <li>killing a white unicorn: -2000 </li>
      <li>wearing an amulet of chaos, available from Hotzenplotz </li>
      <li>pickpocketing: -50 if N- or higher </li>
      <li>robbing shops: worst in Lawenilothehl </li>
      <li>permanently pissing off a town </li>
      <li>digging graves: -100 </li>
      <li>eating undead corpses </li>
      <li>creating undead slaves: -300 </li>
      <li>attacking monsters with a weapon of vampirism: -1 every time
        HP is drained </li>
      <li>wearing armor of chaos </li>
      <li>reading tract of chaos </li>
      <li>causing an explosion that injures/kills friendly/tame
        creatures: -500 or -750 </li>
      <li>attacking with the Scythe of Corruption: -Damage Dealt </li>
      <li>chopping trees in Terinyo: -10 </li>
      <li>giving meat to animals: -10 </li>
      <li>sacrificing friendly monsters </li>
      <li>using Ventriloquism: -10 </li>
      <li>destroying lawful altar: -1500, other altars: -200 </li>
      <li>using Necromancer's lvl 25 Shadow Touch: -Damage dealt
        (sometimes) </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <b>One time chaotic acts</b> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>learning Pick Pockets skill: -100 </li>
      <li>telling the Tiny Girl you killed her dog: -600 </li>
      <li>killing the Sheriff: -50 </li>
      <li>killing the Healer: -200 </li>
      <li>sacrificing the Healer: -2000 </li>
      <li>using Ventriloquism on Thrundarr: -1000 </li>
      <li>digging Griff's grave: -250 </li>
      <li>telling Blup you killed his mom: -1000 </li>
      <li>completing Ratling Rebel's request to kill the Arena Master:
        -500 </li>
      <li>killing the Greater White Unicorn (Yrruir): -4000 </li>
      <li>completing Gaab'Bay quest: -1000 </li>
      <li>completing Greater Black Unicorn quest: -2000 </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.2.1.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.1.4 Lawful acts</h4>
    Changing from chaotic towards neutrality and law is more difficult.
    The following actions move the PC towards lawful:
    <p> <b>Repeatable lawful acts</b> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>killing certain chaotic monsters, notably most dragons,
        demons, grues, some giants, steel golems and most chaos monsters
      </li>
      <li>killing a black unicorn: +100 </li>
      <li>wearing an amulet of order, available from Tywat Pare </li>
      <li>giving food or gold to beggars: +1 for every 20 gp, max +50
        (1000 gp) </li>
      <li>giving seeds to farmers, or trading tools for rations with
        them: +1-10 </li>
      <li>giving healing potions or stethoscope to village elder:
        +50-250 </li>
      <li>giving outlaw type of corpses to sheriff: +5-1000 </li>
      <li>giving candy to children or Blup: +2 or +10 </li>
      <li>healing the PC's pet (only when actually injured) </li>
      <li>self-flagellation, using a whip in the tool slot </li>
      <li>wearing armor of order </li>
      <li>reading tract of order </li>
      <li>offering peace: +50-200 </li>
      <li>blessing a monster: +5 </li>
      <li>let monster flee in wilderness: +100 (lawful only) </li>
      <li>hearing the chants of the holy chorus in Dwarftown: +1 </li>
      <li>successfully using Gardening to plant a herb seed: +5 </li>
      <li>spending time with lonely NPC: +20 </li>
      <li>giving gold to monsters: +1-50 </li>
      <li>sacrificing CHAOS, +Curs, or +Doom items: +5*item base value </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <b>One time lawful acts</b> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>bringing live Cute Dog to Terinyo: +800 </li>
      <li>telling the Tiny Girl her dog died: +600 </li>
      <li>saving the Carpenter: +1000 </li>
      <li>killing the Mad Carpenter: +50 </li>
      <li>killing the Black Druid: +250 if lawful (moves towards neutral
        if neutral already) </li>
      <li>completing Druid quest: +400 if lawful (move towards neutral
        if already neutral) </li>
      <li>completing Village Elder quest: +500 </li>
      <li>completing Raider Lord quest: +250 if lawful already; towards
        balance otherwise </li>
      <li>killing the Crime Lord: +200-250 </li>
      <li>killing Kranf Niest: +270 </li>
      <li>completing slay random monster quest: +250 </li>
      <li>completing Ogre Cave quest: +250 </li>
      <li>saving the Dying Sage: +5000 </li>
      <li>telling Blup where mom is: +1000 </li>
      <li>killing the Greater Black Unicorn (Riurry): +1000 </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.2.1.5"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.1.5 Miscellaneous changes</h4>
    Upon each alignment change, the following is applied:
    <ul>
      <li>* 1.2 if negative and Unicorn </li>
      <li>* 0.9 if Tree </li>
      <li>* 0.9 if negative and Book or Wand </li>
      <li>* (51 - PCLevel) * 0.02 if change is positive </li>
      <li>/ 2/4/8 if wearing a C/U/B amulet of balance and neutral </li>
    </ul>
    <p> All of the above changing alignment are gradual methods which
      take some time to accomplish an alignment change. Without
      question, the fastest and easiest way to change alignment is by
      making sacrifices on an altar. See the section below about altars
      for more alignment change strategy.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.2.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.2 Piety</h4>
    Piety level determines your status towards a deity. Three piety
    levels for three gods (lawful, neutral, chaotic) are always
    maintained. They can change arbitrarily, wrapping around integer
    boundaries.

    <p> For the usual ways of altering piety (see later sections <a
        "#0.2.4"="">0.2.4</a> Praying and <a href="#0.2.3.3">0.2.3.3</a>
      Sacrificing) the two rival deities gain or lose 1/30th the amount
      of piety (rounded down) that the aligned deity loses or gains. So
      pissing off one God makes the others happy. That doesn't apply to
      crownings or to any of the miscellaneous changes above.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.2.2.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.2.2 Piety loss</h4>
    As referred to in the <a
      href="adomman-D.html#D2">ADOM Manual</a>,
    a PC's piety level is positively affected by the sacrifices made to
    the PC's god, and negatively affected by prayers. Remember that the
    value of sacrifices is dependent on a PC's race. Piety level
    constantly decreases with time, so sacrifices made in the early game
    will have little effect after many game turns have passed. In
    practice, this means that a PC who wants to keep his god happy
    should sacrifice items throughout the game. If a PC wants to be
    (pre- post- or normally) crowned, he should have a very large cache
    of valuable material to sacrifice. This can include live sacrifices,
    of course, which are always valuable. As stated in the table above,
    the PC loses 1% of piety every 220 actions.
    <p> <a name="0.2.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.3 Altars <tt>_</tt></h4>
    Altars have an alignment score much like the PC, one crucial
    difference is that the caps are much higher - 1 million stones in
    either direction. Initial value appears to be random from -2000 to
    2000, making N altars twice as common as the other types. Altars are
    generally used for status identification, water manipulation,
    sacrificing, or converting the altar or the PC to a different
    alignment.
    <p> <a name="0.2.3.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.3.1 Status identification</h4>
    An altar of a co-aligned deity will reveal the status of any item
    that is dropped on the altar, i. e. whether they are blessed,
    uncursed, or cursed. This happens regardless of piety. Dropping
    items on a non-co-aligned altar will result in an annoyed deity and
    rats being summoned, item destruction or curse might also occur.
    <p> <a name="0.2.3.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.3.2 Water manipulation <tt>!</tt></h4>
    If your deity is very pleased (see later sacrificing) with you, he
    or she will bless any potion of water that is dropped on the altar,
    resulting in extremely useful and valuable holy water. Dropping
    water on non-aligned altar will result in unholy water, which could
    be used to curse items, should you ever want this.
    <p> <a name="0.2.3.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.3.3 Sacrificing <tt>O</tt></h4>
    The main thing you do on altars is sacrificing (or <tt>O</tt>ffering).
    Things that can be sacrificed include items, food, monsters and
    gold. When sacrificing items, you stand on top of the altar and <tt>O</tt>ffer
    the item, which will then be accepted or rejected by the deity. When
    sacrificing monsters, you stand away from the altar, wait for the
    monster to step onto the altar, and then <tt>O</tt>ffer it. Note
    that most humanoid monsters have the ability to speak. This means
    they can sacrifice the PC. Most, but not all, humanoids are chaotic.
    So idly standing around on an altar, especially a chaotic one, near
    humanoid enemies is a very unwise thing to do.
    <p> Priests recieve +50% to all sacrifice values; Paladins +20%. At
      high levels, sacrifice values are reduced.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.2.3.3.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.3.3.1 Sacrificing items</h4>
    When sacrificing items, one might want to keep in mind the fact that
    some races' deities specially favor some item types. These can be
    found in the <a
      href="adomman-D.html#D2">ADOM Manual</a>
    and are listed here for reference. The modifier quantitates a
    percentage bonus in terms of piety.

    <p> Other observations: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Artifacts can be sacrificed and are valuable. </li>
      <li>Sacrificing an item or artifact which grants +Curs, +Doom, or
        CHAOS, gains alignment; +5 stones per gp of the item's base
        value. Beware of this if the PC is close to (pre)crowning. </li>
      <li>Chaos Orbs cannot be sacrificed. Attempting to do so will
        cause them to reappear on the altar. </li>
      <li>Sacrificing a god gift on the altar of the god who gave it
        causes -Fate -Luck +Curs +Doom, and the PC loses piety equal to
        twice what it would have gained. </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>0.2.3.3.2 Sacrificing food <tt>%</tt></h4>
    Food is quite profitable for any race based on its nutrition value,
    making blessed stomafillia herbs especially preffered, since they
    are plentiful resource once a living herb pattern is created - refer
    to section <a href="#0.13.6">0.13.6</a>.
    <p> Sacrificing food uses a different set of rules from eating it.
      Start with the base satiation value, then: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>blessed: +25% </li>
      <li>cursed: -50% </li>
      <li>cooked: +100% </li>
      <li>Wolf birthsign: +10% </li>
      <li>savegame cheating: -95% </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Stomafilia herb gives 300/240/120 piety depending on B/U/C
      status. Other herbs score is negligible: only 5.92/4.8/2.4 per
      herb, rounded down. Stomacemptia herbs score the least, a mere
      0.32 piety per herb, regardless of status. Sacrificing ratling
      food (you will not be prompted for an amount) will destroy the
      entire stack and give -200 piety.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.2.3.3.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.3.3.3 Sacrificing monsters</h4>
    Sacrificing monsters can be very bountiful, especially on levels
    with a high monster generation rate. Live sacrifices score 3 times
    as the value of corresponding corpse. There are a few things to be
    remembered, though:
    <ul>
      <li>Lawful and neutral gods don't like it when you sac "their
        beings", i.e. neutral beings to a neutral god or lawfuls to a
        lawful god. Chaotics don't care. This makes the situation
        simplest for chaotic PCs. They can sacrifice anything on chaotic
        altars with no fear of alignment change. This also means the
        situation is at a dead end: chaotic PC + chaotic altar means no
        alignment change is possible. </li>
      <li>Sacrifices of pets, and sacrifices of Druid's animals are
        always treated as chaotic. </li>
      <li>Bred, summoned, undead, unlife beings and animated trees can
        not be sacrificed. </li>
      <li>Dwarves (other than small dwarf and dwarven chaos knight)
        cannot be sacrificed in Dwarftown, regardless of the altar's
        alignment. </li>
      <li>Priests (Ruun) cannot be sacrificed on any altar anywhere.
        Merely attempting will make them hostile. </li>
      <li>No monster can be sacrificed on an elemental temple altars
        which is still chaotic. Orb guardians cannot be sacrificed on
        elemental temple altars even after conversion. </li>
      <li>Sacrificing a monster puts it on the kill list and has all the
        normal effects of killing it. The experience gain from doing
        this is just 1/20. </li>
      <li>Sacrificed monsters drop all carried items, but no fixed
        drops. </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>0.2.3.3.4 Sacrificing gold <tt>$</tt></h4>
    Sacrificing gold is most straightforward and safest. Gold coin gives
    about 0.32 piety per gold coin, except for Dwarves who get about
    0.48 piety (because their deities likes cash especially). Or roughly
    triple (double) the amount of piety needed and there's your gold
    cost.

    <p> <a name="0.2.3.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.3.4 Converting an altar or PC</h4>
    Altars are not simply converted, they experience alignment motion
    just like the PC. Exception: an altar cannot swing from L to C in a
    single move, or vice versa, if this would happen the altar is set to
    plus or minus 749 (extreme N+/N-) instead.
    <p> Sacrificing items, food, gold or monsters on an altar can change
      the alignment of the PC or the alignment of the altar. In general,
      small sacrifices move the alignment of the PC towards the
      alignment of the altar. Note, however, that sacrificing at a
      lawful altar will not move a PCs alignment all the way to L+.
      Likewise, sacrificing at a chaotic altar will not move a PCs
      alignment all the way to C-. To achieve these alignments, the PC
      has to commit other lawful or chaotic acts, respectively (or wear
      an amulet corresponding to the desired alignment, preferably
      blessed). Large sacrifices move the alignment of the altar towards
      that of the PC. Live sacrifices can fall into either category
      depending on the experience level of the PC and the level of the
      monster being sacrificed. Converting the alignment of a PC or an
      altar with live sacrifices is a somewhat tricky and complicated
      business and can have dire consequences if the sacrificing is done
      incorrectly. Using gold is much more straightforward. To move a
      PC's alignment towards that of an altar, sacrifice small amounts
      of gold, 10 or 20 pieces, repeatedly. This will eventually result
      in a message: "*WELCOME BELIEVER*" when the PC's alignment changes
      to that of the altar. An additional message, "You feel your morals
      changing." occurs when changing from lawful to neutral on a
      chaotic altar or from chaotic to neutral on a lawful altar. The
      exception to this easy alignment conversion is the case of highly
      experienced chaotic PCs. More about that special case is found in
      section <a href="#4">4</a>, ultra endings. To change the
      alignment of an altar to match the PC's, sacrifice at least 3000
      gold at one time. The 3000 figure is a minimum; more may be
      required depending on the PC's experience level.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.2.3.4.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.3.4.1 Observations</h4>
    Some observations about sacrificing on nonaligned altars and
    changing the alignment of altars with live sacrifices:
    <ul>
      <li>Druids should be very careful to avoid sacrificing animals at
        any time. Sacrificing pets or, for a non-chaotic Druid, animals,
        is an extremely chaotic act; -100 alignment for every xp the
        monster would ordinarily have given on death. Sacrificing an
        animal as a non-chaotic Druid will set piety to -2000 if it was
        positive, or substract 2000 otherwise. </li>
      <li>If sacrificing on an elemental temple altar and not crowned,
        all alignment changes to the altar are forced to be in the C
        direction. </li>
      <li>Any time a PC sacrifices at a nonaligned altar, <i>two</i>
        gods are involved: the PC's god, who may accept a large enough
        sacrifice and fight the nonaligned god for control of the altar,
        and the nonaligned god, who may accept small sacrifices from the
        PC and move the PCs alignment towards that of the altar. This
        also means there are two gods who may object to live sacrifices.
        It is always unwise to sacrifice creatures of the PC's alignment
        or the altar's alignment. The exception is chaotic PCs
        sacrificing at chaotic altars as described above. </li>
      <li>The fact that two deities are involved when sacrificing on a
        nonaligned altar means a puzzling phenomenon may occur when
        sacrificing your race's god's preferred items on a nonaligned
        altar. The PC's deity may be able to accept the sacrifice and
        "deeply appreciate" it while simutaneously the nonaligned deity
        is angered by the fact that a nonaligned PC used the altar.
        Depending on the PC's piety relationship with the nonaligned god
        (it is possible to have a piety relationship with more than one
        god), this may result in a "deeply appreciates" message as well
        as a negative effect such as inventory cursing or destruction. </li>
      <li>A live sacrifice at a nonaligned altar behaves similarly to
        non-live sacrifices in that small sacrifices move the PC toward
        the alignment of the altar while large ones move the altar to
        the PC's alignment, but it is much more difficult to predict
        exactly what will happen. There are many factors involved: the
        PC's experience level, crowned vs uncrowned status, piety
        relationship with both the PC's god and the nonaligned god as
        well as the experience level of the monster being sacrificed. A
        goblin is considered a large sacrifice for a level one PC but
        small for a level ten PC. It is very difficult to predict
        exactly what will happen in borderline cases. After reaching
        experience level five or so, it becomes very risky to attempt an
        altar conversion using a low level live sacrifice such as an orc
        or goblin. The god's standards are higher than that by this
        point. </li>
      <li>If the PC angers a god by sacrificing one of his creatures,
        several negative consequences may result. For example, if a PC
        sacrifices a creature of his own alignment his god responds
        with: "*BE WARNED! SACRIFICING MY OWN CREATURES IS NOT SOMETHING
        I WELCOME WITH JOY!*" Repeating this act results in: "*YOU DARE
        TO SACRIFICE ONE OF MY CREATURES?* *DEFILER*" This may be
        followed by: "-deity- luckily seems unconcerned." depending on
        the PC's piety level. Repeating again results in the same two
        messages followed by conversion of a neutral altar to chaotic.
        This example was done with a neutral PC, exp lvl 5, sacrificing
        neutrals on a neutral altar which became chaotic. The PC did not
        gain the cursed or doomed intrinsics, nor did his alignment
        change. </li>
      <li>A second example: a chaotic PC sacrificing neutral creatures
        on a neutral altar: First: "*YOU DARE TO SACRIFICE ONE OF MY
        CREATURES?* *DEFILER* You suddenly hear a thundering voice. *I*
        hereby punish thee, puny mortal. Your equipment turns to dust."
        Next: "*I* hereby punish thee, puny mortal! You barely notice
        some thoughts: I can't believe it!" The second message here is
        because the PC was wearing artifacts and artifacts only. The PC
        did not gain the cursed or doomed intrinsics. If the PC had been
        wearing any non-artifact equipment, it would have been
        destroyed. If the PC wore nothing, he gained the doomed, and not
        the cursed, intrinsic. </li>
      <li>The implication of the above paragraph should be obvious: Wear
        <i>artifacts and artifacts only</i> when attempting to convert
        an altar. Wield a si if necessary. This completely avoids the
        equipment destruction and dooming penalties. </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>0.2.3.4.2 Possibilities</h4>
    The chart below shows all of the possible combinations for PCs
    sacrificing live monsters on aligned and nonaligned altars. The
    "altar moves to" field <i>assumes the sacrifice is successful</i>.
    A dash means there is no change in the altar; these are the "proper"
    sacrifices a PC makes in order to gain piety and move towards the
    extreme of his alignment. The "god irritated" field is as follows:
    Yes means the PC's god is irritated - a lawful PC tried to sacrifice
    a lawful creature or a neutral PC tried to sacrifice a neutral
    creature. No means the sacrifice was proper, the god accepted the
    sacrifice, the PC gains piety and moves closer to the extreme of his
    alignment. Fight means, it is possible the original god who owned
    the altar fights, and loses every time, to the god taking possession
    of it. Whether the fight actually occurs depends on the value of the
    sacrifice.
    <p> How the PC's alignment or piety level changes when converting
      altars is not proven for all cases. Note the case of a neutral
      sacrificing neutrals on a neutral altar. It is correct as written.
      The altar moves to chaotic with no (or a very, very small)
      alignment change or other negative consequences to the PC. Also
      note the remarkable case of neutral PCs sacrificing neutral
      monsters on a chaotic altar. This converts the altar to neutral
      with no noticeable alignment change. Lawfuls sacrificing lawfuls
      on a lawful altar may convert the altar to neutral, but not
      always. The PC always receives a noticeable alignment drop.</p>

    <p> Note that only champions of Balance or Order can convert the
      altars in the elemental temples.</p>
    <p> If all of this has confused more than it has helped, here are
      some rules of thumb: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>DO NOT sacrifice a creature whose alignment is the same as the
        PC's or the altar's. If you need to take advantage of live
        sacrifices to increase piety, only sacrifice nonaligned monsters
        on an aligned altar. </li>
      <li>If you must convert an altar, do it with gold. It is much,
        much safer. </li>
    </ol>
    <p> <a name="0.2.3.4.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.3.4.3 Conversion summary</h4>
    If the alignment of the sacrifice is different from the alignment of
    the altar, conversions may occur. First, the altar is drawn towards
    the alignment of the sacrifice by an amount proportional to the
    value of the sacrifice. This effect is three times larger for forced
    chaotic sacrifices. Next, if the altar is now still not of PC's
    alignment, PC's alignment will be shifted; generally 500 alignment
    points in the direction of the altar's old alignment; it could be
    larger if a huge sacrifice was made and somehow failed to convert
    the altar.
    <p> If the sacrifice alignment is the same as the altar alignment,
      PC gains piety. The altar's alignment is proportionally drawn
      towards neutrality or the extremes. If the altar is neutral, PC's
      alignment will be proportionally drawn towards neutrality,
      otherwise no effect on alignment. If the altar does not match PC's
      alignment (this is only possible for forced chaotic sacrifices),
      alignment will be pulled slightly towards the altar.</p>
    <p> Effects are applied for PC's piety with the altar's god. If
      piety with the current god is negative, there is a check
      preventing more than one of the same punishment in a row.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.2.3.4.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.3.4.4 Recovering from errors</h4>
    Precautions:
    <p> When converting an altar, remove all gear except for artifacts.
      Also, remember that the bigger your sacrifice, the more likely it
      is that the altar converts - but remember, this sacrifice probably
      has minimal effect on piety, so don't make it ridiculously huge.</p>
    <p> Dropping items on a nonaligned altar will make the deity that
      owns the altar angry. This causes some warning messages along the
      lines of "GET YOUR JUNK OFF MY ALTAR." Ordinarily this should be
      enough warning. If an extended drop command is used, however,
      there seems to be a bug present that allows the dropping to
      continue until the angry deity curses the inventory of the PC.
      Watch out for this.</p>
    <p> If things go wrong: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Inventory cursed
        <p> By the time you have enough valuable stuff to sacrifice, you
          should be able to uncurse a cursed inventory with little
          trouble. Get to an aligned altar immediately. Bless your
          potions of water by dropping them on the altar if you are in
          sufficient standing with your deity. If not, sacrifice gold
          until you are. Dip a scroll of uncursing into your new holy
          water, read it, and voila, all of your stuff is back to
          uncursed status. Obviously, previously blessed status of
          inventory items has been lost.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>Equipment turned to dust
        <p> This is why it's always recommended to remove non-artifacts
          before converting altars - you don't want to lose those seven
          league boots or that nifty sword of sharpness, do you?
          However, the equipment turned to dust penalty can be useful as
          a last resort for getting rid of a stubborn item. Repeatedly
          praying will anger a deity to this point.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>Doomed
        <p> If the PC had no equipment, dooming rather than equipment
          turned to dust will occur. This is why the PC should have <i>some</i>
          equipment worn, even a si. It will be necessary to sacrifice
          enough to get your piety all the way up to very close, at
          which time the dooming will be removed. It is handy to know
          how to remove dooming and cursing in any case, since these
          intrinsics can be caused by things other than mistakes with
          altars - robbing shops with lawfuls, attacking karmics in
          melee and pools spring to mind.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>The worst two - bolt and summoning
        <p> Ordinarily these never occur when mistakes with altars are
          made. It takes dooming then repeated additional prayers for a
          deity to get this mad. However, there are two situations where
          this will happen <i>immediately</i> - falling from champion
          status and sacrificing a gift from your deity. The deity casts
          an energy bolt at the PC, which, strangely enough, the PC
          seems to be immune to more often than not. The deity is
          further incensed by this and says "DAMN, YOU'LL SUFFER FOR
          THIS HUMILIATION TOO!" and summons creatures dependent on the
          deity: lawful deity - solars, neutral deity - holy slayers,
          chaotic diety - greater daemons. The exact sequence of events
          is dependent upon what the PC is doing, praying repeatedly
          while doomed or falling from champion status. In the former
          case there may be additional monsters summoned prior to those
          listed above.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p> Another case which causes summoning is to get as far as possible
      from a particular god then sacrifice on that god's altar. For
      instance, if an initially chaotic PC sacrifices repeatedly on a
      neutral altar to achieve very good standing with the neutral god
      then sacrifices on a lawful altar, creatures may be summoned.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.2.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.4 Praying <tt>_</tt></h4>
    Unlike sacrificing, you don't need an altar when conducting prayers.
    Praying uses up your piety for an immediate reward, which you
    however cannot choose, but depends on your status and order of
    precedence - see later. It's quite possible to have a prayer
    answered and the cost pulls you down to low enough to recieve a
    warning, or penalty, but there are some safeguards against this
    happening and it's unlikely unless you have been doing a lot of
    praying. Here's a funny example:
    <pre>You pray to Istaria.
Your cursed broadsword (+1, 1d7+3) glows in a silvery light.
You suddenly hear a thundering voice.
"*I* hereby punish thee, puny mortal!"
Your equipment turns to dust.
</pre>
    The main safeguard is that you cannot drop more than 3 levels of
    piety in answering a prayer if you start off at least "Inner peace".
    Instead you will be at the bottom of the level three below where you
    started from. For example if you start at 3000 piety and your prayer
    costs 15000 piety you will end up at -50 piety. That applies to
    unanswered prayers too - which also cost piety. I don't know but I
    don't think it applies to non-prayer piety penalties but the only
    one big enough to matter would be destroying an altar I think...
    <p> A second safeguard is that if your prayer is NOT answered and
      you had at least "Unconcerned" then, if you drop to one of the low
      levels, you will NOT receive a penalty due to low piety (or a
      warning message) until the next time you pray.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.2.4.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.4.1 Prices for praying</h4>
    In general the cost of a prayer or unanswered prayer is the base
    cost multiplied by a factor that increases incredibly fast according
    to how many OF THAT KIND OF PRAYER (or how many unanswered prayers)
    you have had with that character. The count increases even if you
    switch deities. The multiplier is 'triangular n' or n(n+1)/2.
    <p> For example the first unanswered prayer costs 20 piety. The
      second will cost 60, then 120, 200, 300, 420 and so on. The
      formula for the total piety cost of n prayers of the same kind is
      n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 multiplied by the base cost.</p>
    <p> After all that there is a final deduction to the cost of 50% if
      you are a champion and Paladins seem to get prayer at 2/3rds cost
      (not Priests though), or 1/3rd if crowned. Those do NOT apply to
      the cost of pre-post crownings.</p>
    <p> In the table below, if not mentioned otherwise, at least 50
      piety is required in addition to the requirement mentioned. In
      elemental temples, this requirement is 2 levels higher (3000 piety
      for standard rewards).</p>

    <p> [1] The <i>base</i> cost of divine mana is between 450 and
      about 520 depending upon how starved you are. The cost of 450 is
      if you have just become hungry, the cost of 500 is for when you

    <ol>
      <li>urgent heal (health &lt; 25%) </li>
      <li>remove sickness </li>
      <li>urgent food (satiation &lt; 100 ("Hungry!")) </li>
      <li>remove cursed / doomed </li>
      <li>cure blindness </li>
      <li>heal (health &lt; 75%) </li>
      <li>remove confused </li>
      <li>remove slowed </li>
      <li>cure poison </li>
      <li>remove mute </li>
      <li>remove stunned </li>
      <li>food (satiation &lt; 200 ("Hungry")) </li>
      <li>gain mana (even if you are just 1 pt below max) </li>
      <li>remove darkness (diameter = 9) </li>
      <li>uncurse an equipped item </li>
    </ol>
    <p> Note that heal and food have two levels of precedence which cost
      the same and count as the same prayer. Also I couldn't seem to get
      cursed or doomed removed using prayer if I had both of them at the
      same time (by prayer that is - you can do it by sacrificing), so
      effectively they have the same precedence. Remove stunning may be
      2 places higher in the list... needs a little more testing. Didn't
      attempt to find the precedence of preventing breeding on a level
      by prayer. Crowning seems to have the highest precedence, but then
      it also seems to heal you.</p>

    <h4>0.2.5 Crowning, precrowning and postcrowning</h4>
    Crowning, precrowning or postcrownig is achieved via praying,
    provided your piety level is sufficient (see section <a
      "#0.2.3.3.5"="">0.2.3.3.5</a>).
    <p> <a name="0.2.5.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.5.1 Requirements</h4>
    Crowning itself requires "Extremely close" (30000 piety) and costs
    40000 piety but does not reduce you to below 20000 piety. So
    effectively the cost is 10000. Very odd behaviour. In practise then
    the crowning costs only 10000. Pre or post crownings cost the same.
    Although I have listed their base cost as 50000 (meaning that the
    first one costs 50000, 2nd costs 150000, then 300000 etc) there are
    a couple of oddities. Sometimes (usually) there is a special
    pre/post crowning that costs only 10000 piety. The rest use the
    formula above but all cost an extra 10000 more than the formula
    would suggest. However it looks like you may need to have 20000
    piety more than the cost of the pre/post crowning to get it.

    <p> Pre- and postcrowning gives the PC a random artifact, which will
      be one of the non-guaranteed artifacts. The requirements for pre-
      and postcrowning are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>precrowning occurs only if the PC is not of extreme alignment
        (not L+, N= or C-) </li>
      <li>extremely close </li>
      <li>character level &gt;= 8 + 3 * artifacts generated </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Crowning can occur at any experience level.</p>
    <p> Postcrowning doesn't include the non-extreme alignment
      restriction.</p>
    <p> Note that PCs who achieve precrowning or crowning may never
      again see the "extremely close" status message. In this case,
      determining whether the PC has sufficient piety for further
      precrownings, crowning or postcrowning is a matter of trial and
      error. This is not as bad as it might seem, since praying uses up
      very little piety if prayers "remain unheard" - that is, the deity
      does nothing.</p>
    <p> These seem to be the most important requirements in 1.0.0 - for
      instance, the PC may be wearing cursed items and the pre- or
      postcrowning will still occur.</p>
    <p> For crowning, the PC must be at extreme alignment and extremely
      close (or have enough piety at very close). The PC must not be
      intrinsically Cursed or Doomed for any type of crowning.
      Ordinarily, this will never be a problem, since achieving very
      close status removes these intrinsics. However, if the PC is
      wearing or wielding an item that causes Cursing or Dooming (the
      Crown of Science, Executor, etc.), crowning will not occur.</p>
    <p> Getting pre- or post-crowned increases the piety required for
      further pre- or post-crownings.</p>
    <p> As an example to show how this works quantitatively, Malte
      Helmert did <a
        href="adomgb-0-2-crowning.html">research</a>
      using gold as the sole sacrificial item.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.2.5.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.5.2 Rewards</h4>
    Upon crowning, the PC receives an immunity, an artifact crowning
    gift which is preselected from a list of appropriate items for the
    PC's race and class (see section below), a blessed amulet matching
    the PC's alignment, a permanent blessing, the ability to convert
    elemental altars for champions of Balance and Order, to wear
    artifacts and other food consumption adding items with half burden
    on metabolism and half praying cost. Chaotic champions also receive
    corruptions.
    <p> <a name="0.2.5.2.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.5.2.1 Immunity</h4>
    Note that the immunity received will not be one the PC already has,
    whether through eating appropriate corpses or worn items. For
    instance, if the PC is wearing the Ring of Immunity at crowning
    time, he will receive no immunity at all - take it off! (as of
    1.1.1, it seems Ring of Immunity has no effect on immunity granted)
    Likewise, the Ancient Mummy Wrapping can be worn or the scorched
    spear wielded at crowning time to ensure the PC does not receive the
    rather undesirable immunity to cold.
    <p> The immunity the PC receives can be figured out by the message
      that it gives:</p>

    <p> Note that Dwarves of most classes can receive Hammerhead as a
      crowning gift (except Dwarven Beastfighters and Monks). Likewise,
      High Elves and Gray Elves can receive Sun's Messenger as a
      crowning gift (except Beastfighters). If appropriate, chance for
      receiving race-based gift is 12.5%. In general, there are six
      possible gifts. There are exceptions: see Barbarian, Beastfighter,
      Mindcrafter, Paladin, Thief and Wizard.</p>
    <p> Andrew Skalski provided the explanation for this. By examining
      the g16p2 executable, he determined that there are indeed less
      than six possible crowning gifts for these classes. However, the
      blank spots are filled in with a duplicate of one of the
      possibilities. This means that these classes are twice as likely
      to receive one of the doubled possibilities. The updated table
      above now reflects these observations. The order the artifacts are
      listed in is alphabetical and has no significance.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.2.5.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.5.3 Fallen Champions</h4>
    If the PC changes their alignment after becoming a champion, they
    will become a <i>fallen champion</i> and be treated with fury by
    the deity that crowned them. Punishments for fallen champions
    include:
    <ul>
      <li>Removal of permanent blessing, reduced prayer cost, ability to
        convert elemental altars and decreased food consumption per
        equipped artifact (the elemental immunity and items granted by
        the deity will not be taken away). </li>
      <li>Removal of any further (post)crowning possibility, not even by
        a different deity. </li>
      <li>Cursing and Dooming. </li>
      <li>Being hit by a bolt of black energy, which the PC is sometimes
        immune to. </li>
      <li>Summoning of monsters to avenge the deity (either this or the
        bolt, not both) - lawful deities summon solars, neutral deities
        summon spectres, and chaotic deities summon greater daemons. </li>
      <li>Losing the possibility of a special ending if the player is
        not in the Chaos Plane - fallen champions will not survive
        passage through the Chaos Gate. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.2.6"></a></p>
    <h4>0.2.6 Tracts <tt>"</tt></h4>
    Tracts are religious books related to particular alignment, weighing
    somewhat more than regular spellbooks. Reading them have the
    following effects:
    <ul>
      <li>move PC's alignment to the tract alignment </li>
      <li>increase piety for the god of tract, and decrease piety for
        other two gods (except tract of balance) </li>
      <li>tracts of order remove corruption, tracts of chaos grant
        corruption </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Tracts have finite uses, measured in turns of reading. This is
      initially set to 1d1000 for a brand new tract. Each time you
      attempt to read a tract, you will spend 20d10 turns reading it, or
      the remaining time, whichever is smaller. While you are reading a
      tract, your body armor cannot be damaged, and teleportitis is
      disabled, in addition to the normal effects of a long action. If
      you are interrupted, no further effect will occur.</p>
    <p> In the formulae below, T is the number of turns spent on
      reading. Piety effects from reading tracts are "raw" piety
      changes; they do not result in the typical -1/30 other god effect.
      If your piety with some god is reduced to or below -500 by a
      tract, you will suffer negative piety effects (inventory cursing,
      etc.), unless your god deflects them. Your god will never deflect
      his own penalties, and will deflect the penalties of other gods if
      and only if your piety with your current god is greater than 1/8
      of the absolute value of the punishing god. Deflection does not
      cost piety.</p>

    <p> <a name="0.3.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.3.1 Preventing starvation</h4>
    Starvation is often a definite problem for new players. Rest assured
    that there is enough food provided in the game to survive. The
    easiest source at the start of the game is Munxip's food store in
    Terinyo. He sells primarily large rations, which are heavy at 200
    stones each. These can be useful for training the Strength of PCs
    that start with low Strength. Food will be found in the various
    dungeons available from quests assigned in Terinyo, and in all
    dungeons, for that matter. If the PC elects to take Tywat Pare's
    quest to find and kill Kranach and his gang in the wilderness,
    remember that wilderness square are big, take considerable game time
    to cross, and therefore require much more food per game turn than
    exploring in the dungeons.
    <p> Once the PC finishes the area around Terinyo, he will have to
      cross a large area of wilderness to reach the Caverns of Chaos,
      the main dungeon in the game. The same warning about food
      requirements in the wilderness applies. After reaching the Caverns
      of Chaos, a short descent to the Arena level will provide a very
      good food source. Ratling traders are found on this level, selling
      various comestibles. The best are cooked lizards. These are light
      at 3 stones each, fairly inexpensive and nutritious. Food problems
      are generally solved at this point.</p>
    <p> Most of the corpses that monsters leave are edible. Some are to
      be avoided. Kobolds of any type cause sickness. Rats (simple rats,
      not giant rats) will make any race other than Trolls or Orcs vomit
      (no satiation). Eating humanoid corpses, such as goblins, causes
      the message "This meal does not sit well with you." or "You feel
      uneasy." to be displayed. Several players have tested eating a
      variety of humanoid corpses while wearing the Platinum Girdle,
      which kills if a chaotic act is committed. It never killed the
      PCs.</p>
    <p> Having said that, PCs who have trained the Law skill will
      receive the message "You feel as if transgressing some law." when
      eating a humanoid corpse, even a lowly goblin. However, there is
      no effect on alignment. This seems to imply that there is a bug
      somewhere in the humanoid corpse-eating code. Bear in mind that
      Thomas himself has stated that eating humanoid corpses is not a
      chaotic act. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dwarves refuse to eat dwarven corpses. They also refuse to eat
        orc corpses unless they are starving. </li>
      <li>Hurthlings refuse to eat black hurthling corpses. </li>
      <li>Races other than Trolls refuse to eat doppleganger corpses
        unless starving. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Be aware that some food items are susceptible to rotting. These
      include corpses of all types, apples and pieces of raw meat.
      Eating rotten food does not cause sickness or other negative
      effects. Food that starts to rot has actually become cursed and
      will soon disappear. Eat it quickly if possible. In the case of
      corpses, especially strategically important ones such as chaos
      creatures or quicklings, rotting may be indefinitely stopped by
      repeatedly dipping the corpse in holy water when necessary, thus
      blessing it. Cooked corpses decay more slowly than uncooked
      corpses. Cooked corpses can be created with the Cooking skill or
      by blasting them with fire, from the fire bolt spell, for
      instance. Blessed cooked corpses carried by PCs with Food
      Preservation at 100 decay at the slowest rate. This is very handy
      for preserving the corpses of Chaos Orb guardians (section <a
        href="#0a311">0.10.3.1.1</a>).</p>
    <p> Wearing certain items causes a need for increased food
      consumption. This includes all items that grant invisibility,
      artifacts (especially for PCs that are not crowned) and worst of
      all (since they grant no positive effect) amulets of hunger.
      Interestingly, intrinsics, including intrinsic invisibility, do
      not have any effect on food consumption. Likewise, the Fate smiles
      / Lucky / Cursed / Doomed intrinsics have no effect.</p>
    <p> The level of satiation is displayed on the screen. High levels
      of satiation (satiated or bloated) will cause a speed decrease.</p>
    <p> One type of herb, stomafillia, is extremely filling. Blessed
      stomafillia will cause a PC to be bloated immediately.</p>
    <p> The satiation value of food items is increased by 25% for
      blessed items and decreased by 50% for cursed items. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trolls have food consumption doubled.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Monks have food consumption halved.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Farmers have food consumption halved starting from level 12.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.3.1.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.3.1.1 Increasing satiation</h4>
    These are the ways to increase satiation:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>e</tt>ating one of the plentiful types of corpses and food
        (especially blessed stomafillia herbs) </li>
      <li><tt>D</tt>rinking any potion except poison (some are more
        effective than others) </li>
      <li><tt>r</tt>eading a non-cursed scroll of satiation </li>
      <li>successfully <tt>a</tt>pplying the Survival skill in the
        wilderness </li>
      <li>praying<tt>_</tt> when Hungry or worse </li>
      <li>wishing for "satiation" or "food" </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Satiation decreases naturally over time (see next chapter), or
      you can decrease it artificially by eating stomacemptia herbs.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.3.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.3.2 Satiation levels</h4>
    Thanks to Malte Helmert for working out all details of this chapter.
    <p> Most "base" PCs use one unit of nutrition each turn. The units
      of nutrition for the various food items are listed below. None of
      the following applies to food consumption in the big wilderness
      map, where different rules apply (maybe just a multiplier). Apart
      from equipment, the formula for a PC's food consumption per turn
      is as follows:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>1 </td>
          <td>standard </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>+1 </td>
          <td>for Trolls </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>+1 </td>
          <td>when Strained or Strained! </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>+2 </td>
          <td>when Overburdened! </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p> The formula for moving is a bit different (+1 for Trolls still
      applies):</p>
    <p> </p>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>1 </td>
          <td>standard </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>+1 </td>
          <td>when Burdened </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>+2 </td>
          <td>when Strained </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>+3 </td>
          <td>when Strained! </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p> The total value after those modifiers is halved for Farmers of
      Level 12+ and Monks of any level. So, for example, an overburdened
      Human Fighter would consume 3 units per turn, and a Strained!
      Troll Monk would consume 1.5 units per turn. In this case,
      fractions are <i>not</i> rounded away: The character will
      alternate between consuming 1 and 2 units.</p>
    <p> After that, additional modifiers apply, which are <i>not</i>
      halved for Monks or Farmers:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>+3 </td>
          <td>for each (!) equipped item granting Invisibility </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>+0.5 </td>
          <td>for each equipped artifact (rounded down), for uncrowned
            or fallen champion PCs </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>+0.25 </td>
          <td>for each equipped artifact (rounded down), for crowned PCs
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>+15 </td>
          <td>in the wilderness, for non-Trolls </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>+30 </td>
          <td>in the wilderness, for Trolls </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p> Food consumption in the wilderness is independent of movement
      speed, including seven league boots, and terrain type.</p>
    <p> So, for example, a strained Troll Barbarian, crowned chaotic,
      wearing 7 artifacts and one item granting Invisibility will
      consume 7 units per turn (1 standard, 1 troll, 1 strained, 7/4
      rounded down = 1 for the artifacts, 3 for the invisibility).</p>
    <p> From all experiments conducted with WADOMF and g16pre2, there
      was no influence caused by: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>alignment (some suggested that only champions of law get the
        artifact discount, but it is identical for chaotics and
        presumably neutrals) </li>
      <li>being a fallen champion (that is, there is no special penalty
        - it's just like not being crowned) </li>
      <li>any corruption (the suspicious mana battery and corrupted
        tissue corruptions were tested) </li>
      <li>any intrinsic (particularly, intrinsic invisibility does not
        increase food consumption - this was very surprising; likewise,
        the Doomed/Cursed/Lucky/Fate Smile makes no difference) </li>
      <li>the Invisibility spell </li>
      <li>being a Healer or being born in the month of Candle </li>
      <li>HP or PP regeneration rate, having eaten Troll corpses, having
        drunk potions of troll blood or raw mana, wielding regenerating
        items - the last is very surprising </li>
    </ul>
    <p> The different satiation categories are:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <table>
      <caption>Satiation</caption> <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Satiation level</th>
          <th>Satiation display </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2501+ </td>
          <td>Bloated </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1501..2500 </td>
          <td>Satiated </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>200..1500 </td>
          <td>(no display) </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>100..199 </td>
          <td>Hungry </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>50..99 </td>
          <td>Hungry! </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>49- </td>
          <td><font color="red">Starving</font> </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p> A character with satiation level 0 can die because of starvation
      each turn. Apparently no food consumption takes place while
      eating, so it should be impossible to starve to death while
      eating.</p>
    <p> Note also that starvation does not kill until Strength has
      dropped to half of what it was when the Starving message is shown.
      There is a -4 drop on getting to Starving status. From there
      Strength and other attributes will continue to drop until Strength
      reaches 50% of its value when Starving status was reached.</p>
    <p> The exact turn of death seems to be -(Toughness*8)+2, with minor
      variations at some levels. In short, this means that for every
      point of Toughness the character has, their satiation can go 8
      points lower below zero. Thus higher Toughness equals more time to
      find food to reduce starvation.</p>
    <p> Satiation value can flip over 32 bit integer (about 2.1
      billion), similarly to piety level, gold amount, xp amount, etc.
      It can be achieved for example by reading 1.07 million blessed
      scrolls of satiation. At this point, the PC will die.</p>
    <p> Some other observations: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wishing for "satiation" or "food" sets the satiation level to
        5000 if it was below this value. It does nothing otherwise. </li>
      <li>Scrolls of satiation add 2000/1000/0 to the satiation level if
        blessed/uncursed/cursed. </li>
      <li>Apart from corpses, the only food items that can be cooked are
        raw meat and fish meat, as noted in the table. Unlike corpses,
        they can only be cooked with the cooking skill; fire destroys
        them. </li>
      <li>From preliminary testing, it seems that apples and pieces of
        raw meat rot at approximately the same rate. </li>
      <li>Stomafillia herbs are different in that their B/U/C status is
        more influential than for other food items: They yield
        6250/2000/550 points of satiation depending on whether they are
        blessed, uncursed or cursed. </li>
      <li>Stomacemptia herbs are the only non-corpse food items that
        lower the satiation level. Even bad ratling food, despite
        yielding the "you vomit" message, satiates slightly.
        Stomacemptia herbs do not apply a fixed modifier but behave a
        bit differently: <br>
        If the character is not yet starving, the new satiation level is
        set to a fixed value depending on the B/U/C status of the herb
        (rows) and the old satiation value (columns):
        <p> </p>

        <p> Put in words, blessed herbs always set the satiation level
          to the highest possible value of the next lower category (from
          satiated to normal, from normal to hungry, from hungry to very
          hungry, from very hungry to starving), uncursed herbs go two
          such steps, and cursed herbs always go down to starving. If
          the character is already starving (satiation value below 50),
          then the satiation value is decreased by 20, but not below 0,
          irrespective of B/U/C status of the herb. </p>

    <h4>0.3.3 Eating corpses <tt>%</tt></h4>
    In addition to <a href="#Appendix_J">Appendix J</a>, this section lists
    corpse effect in greater detail.
    <p> <a name="0.3.3.1"></a><b>How to read the list</b> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Only corpses with effects are listed. </li>
      <li>Colons (:) symbolize conditions; basically read as 'if (thing
        before the colon) is true, then (do stuff after colon). This is
        often a percentage chance, but it can be other things as well.
        Conditions can stack (meaning multiple things have to be true).
      </li>
      <li>Attribute increases (or decreases) listed by themselves (Such
        as '+1 Pe') without parentheses mean you ALWAYS gain that
        attribute when eating the corpse (provided any conditions are
        true). </li>
      <li>Attribute increases listed in parentheses (like '(+1 St)')
        have a chance to gain that attribute, depending on your current
        amount in that attribute. There is a chart that shows your
        chance to gain. </li>
      <li>Speed increases are all done the same way. I listed them in
        parentheses because they are also harder to gain the higher it
        is. (There is a speed chart as well). </li>
      <li>Commas (,) seperate gains/checks. You gain (or have a chance
        to gain if there are conditions) everything in the list that's
        seperated with a comma. </li>
      <li>Semicolons (;) denote mutually exclusive checks. This means
        you can only get 1 possibility out of the series... I try to use
        square brackets to make it more obvious what is in a series. </li>
      <li>Poison effects have 2 numbers (unlike other status effects) -
        the first is how much (Da)mage the poison does and the second is
        how often ((Fr)equency) that it happens. </li>
      <li>Most bad effects will stack on top of others. If you're
        confused already, and you eat something which confuses you, that
        amount is added to how many turns you'll stay confused. </li>
      <li>'Trains' means that it trains the attribute, so that you have
        a chance to gain it over time (like being burdened trains
        Strength). </li>
      <li>Exclamation points (!) simply mean 'not'. </li>
      <li>Curly brackets at the end of some of the checks are to make it
        plain and obvious what is the highest level of the attribute
        that can be reached by eating the corpse in question. This
        should make it a little easier to understand for anyone who
        doesn't understand the 'code-like' parts. </li>
      <li>"Spellcasting monster" means "[Cursed: 5%: +2d3PP; Uncursed:
        25%: +2d3PP; Blessed: 50%: +2d3PP], 16.7%: +1 Ma". </li>
      <li>"Bad luck" means lose Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics if
        present, and gain Cursed and Doomed intrinsics. </li>
      <li>"Karmic" means it will get the PC somewhat more Luck: if
        Doomed, then lose Doomed, if not then lose Cursed, if neither
        Doomed nor Cursed then gain Lucky, if already have Lucky then
        gain Fate smiles. </li>
      <li>The PC is not sickened eating a rabid dog corpse if wearing
        necklace of rabies resistance. </li>
      <li>MaxAge is never reduced below CurrentAge. </li>
      <li>Level 40+ Assassins cannot be poisoned. </li>

          status) of gaining 2d3 (average 4) Power points. Then you
          become sick; you basically lose 1 sickness point every 20
          turns so 20d8 * 20 is how many turns you'll be sick for
          unassisted.</p>

      <li><b>Chaos Viper</b>: (+1 Dx), -Pois, (+1 Sp), Poisons
        8d5Da_3d3Fr, Corrupts 10d200
        <p> First, you have a chance to gain 1 Dx depending on what your
          Dx is already at. Second, you always gain poison resistance.
          After that you have a chance to gain 1 speed, then you're
          heavily poisoned (on average it will start out dealing 24
          damage every 6 turns, though the fact that it gives poison
          resistance may weaken the effect instantly). Finally, it
          corrupts you for an average of 1005 CP which is about 1
          corruption worth.</p>
        <p> </p>

      <li><b>Ghul</b>: ![-Para]: Paralyzes 2d8
        <p> This one is pretty simple. If you are paralyzation
          resistant, nothing special happens. Otherwise, you're
          paralyzed for 2d8 turns.</p>

        <p> Whooo boy. Thomas sure made the giant-folk complicated,
          didn't he? The code doesn't actually look like this, but this
          was the simplest (believe it or not) way I found to display
          the effect. Notice that the curly brackets at the end give you
          the big picture: They can raise your strength up to 25, no
          higher. Every check has a chance to raise your Strength
          depending on what it already is, and the higher it is the less
          chance you have to raise it. Note also that the attribute
          increases are in parentheses so the actual chance to raise
          from 24 to 25 is a mere 8%.</p>

    <p> Monsters who always leave a corpse are the following uniques:</p>
    <p> Ancient Chaos Wyrm, Ancient Stone Beast, Black Druid, Chaos
      Archmage, Cute Dog, Master Summoner, Minotaur Emperor,
      Multi-headed Chaos Dragon, Oracle, Snake from Beyond.</p>
    <p> Farmers are special case. They never leave a corpse before a
      quest for a farmer corpse is assigned, after which they leave a
      corpse with 50% probability.</p>

            The last recipe gained at skill level 100 is always for
            potions of gain attributes. The first recipe is for potions
            of poison for Assassins. The command <tt>R</tt> brings up
            the recipe list [4]. When the skill level reaches 100,
            mostly blessed potions are created [5]. Mixing the wrong
            ingredients results in an explosion. The diameter is related
            to the PC's Willpower as usual. Damage is 12d12. This can be
            exploited. Run out of castings of Fire Ball? Wear your red

            rotting as fast (4x slower rotting). Useful for preserving
            the corpse of Orb guardians. Cooking takes 20/35/50 turns
            depending on the B/U/C status of the cooking set. Hurthlings

            as well. <tt>a</tt>pply this skill towards any door whose

            traps are easily avoided. Gives a small amount of experience
            when applied successfully. This may be the only way to get
            experience without killing a monster. A skill level of 60 is
            reliable for door traps. Floor traps require higher skill
            level. A skill level of 80 is still risky. [9] </td>

        <tr>
          <td>Dodge </td>
          <td>Very nice DV +10 at skill level 100. Factors into dodging

            200 chance to avoid stone block door traps. Assassins lvl

            weapons which have the Critical property (but not Slaying
            property, which always deliver criticals against vulnerable
            opponents). See <a href="#0.12.3">0.12.3</a>. It increases
            the chance to score critical hits with ordinary missiles
            such as rocks, coins and arrows. The chance is a +Find

            points, but perhaps more importantly, can be used every turn
            to fight sickness. This can be a life saver. First Aid also
            works for poisoning. Apply the skill every time the game
            generates the message about "poison coursing through your
            veins!" There is FirstAid/1.5 % or (To+1)% chance to stop

            double the number of missiles, cursed half. Arrows are about
            two times more abundantly produced than quarrels. There is a
            small chance of producing prefix and suffix missiles, this
            depends on PC's level. Note that tiny quarrels never get
            prefix or suffix. Archers get bonus at level 18. </td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Gardening </td>
          <td>Requires herb seeds to train. Using the skill to plant
            herb seeds is the only way to convert a dungeon level that
            does not support herbs to one that does. Herb farming can
            increase a low level PCs attributes quickly and produce
            endless sacrificial fodder. See sections <a href="#0.6.1.3"
             >0.6.1.3</a><a> and </a><a href="#0.13.6">0.13.6</a>.
            Plant seeds do nothing at all - they don't even train the
            skill. Blessed seeds work better and cursed seeds work
            worse. 90 skill guarantees planting a blessed seed. Planting
            successfully gives +5 alignment. </td>

          <td>Somewhat useful for all, essential for Merchants. Make
            sure it is very high before using it and try to have good
            Charisma, or a price increase will be the most likely
            result. Can be used up to 11 times per level. Price
            multiplier cannot be lowered below 70%. Effectiveness is
            very nonlinear; the skill is useless below ~50, and
            increasing it further than ~65 is pointless. </td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Herbalism </td>
          <td>Very useful for all PCs. Willpower, Toughness and
            Dexterity all go to ~25 with herbs. All herbs picked without
            this skill will be cursed. To use the skill, <tt>a</tt>pply
            it while standing on an herb square. The game indicates the
            health of the plant. Herbs "full of blossoms" can be safely
            picked twice; "strong herbs" can be picked once. Picking
            from a "withered" plant will likely kill it. See also <a

            reading scrolls does not require high Literacy. Getting the
            Weird Tome sets Literacy to 100. Note that you can also

          <td>Necromancy </td>
          <td>Necromancers, of course. Get this to 100 as soon as
            convenient. Do not believe the manual about very slow
            regeneration of Mana. Using the skill trains the Mana
            attribute. All classes can make zombies with the Necromancy
            skill; Necromancers can make other things as their level
            progresses. On unsuccessful attempt, Necromancy is trained
            and the PC loses 3d3 PP. Successful Necromancy gives -300
            Alignment. Only HP and Speed are affected by the type of
            corpse you use -- the Damage, Attacks, DV, and PV are only
            based on the type of slave you create and its level. Some
            corpses are not eligible for Necromancy. These include the
            Cat Lord, Yulgash, Nuurag-Vaarn and Filk, despite the fact
            that they are all humanoid. The game responds with "The
            -foo- corpse turns to dust." The Minotaur Emperor, however
            is eligible and makes a good slave. Corpses should not be
            blessed when used for Necromancy. This results in a slave
            which is critically damaged. See also <a href="#0.11.6">0.11.6</a>.

            traps. Cursed thieves picks may create a door trap. It is
            possible to close and lock a door in one turn by applying
            Pick Locks. Attempting to unlock a trapped door may set it

            given to farmers for a small lawful boost. Doing the same on

            dealing with rivers). Being more burdened, strained etc.
            makes it harder to swim. Drowning damage depends on MaxHP.
            Swimming has an energy cost of 1500 at skill 50+ or 1250
            below (probably a bug). Wearing an amulet of free action

    <p> [4] Ingredients can be potions and herbs. There are 4 levels of
      ingredients: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>potion of booze, potion of water, potion of carrot juice, burb
        root, pepper petal, demon daisy </li>
      <li>potion of healing, potion of insight, potion of troll blood,
        potion of oil, stomafillia herb, curaria mancox herb </li>
      <li>potion of extra healing, potion of invisibility, potion of
        balance, potion of cure poison, potion of wonder, potion of raw
        mana </li>
      <li>potion of strength, potion of youth, potion of longevity,
        potion of ultra healing, potion of cure corruption, potion of
        boost speed </li>
    </ol>
    <p> The available recipes are always for: blindness (1+1), booze
      (1+1), deafness (1+1), poison (1+2), cure poison (1+3), insight
      (2+2), longevity (2+3), extra healing (3+3), youth (3+4), and gain
      attributes (4+4). The two ingredients are never chosen to be the
      same item type. A maximum of one herb per recipe is possible. The
      order is random except for gain attributes.</p>
    <p> [5] Thanks to Krogg and Ascaron for the following observations:
      The level of the Alchemy skill seems to have a definite effect on
      the B/U/C status of the potions produced. Alchemy at 100 when
      creating potions of blindness, for instance, resulted in seven
      uncursed and 25 blessed. Ascaron tested 100 times creating PoGAs.
      The results were 70/28/2 B/U/C using two uncursed potion
      ingredients and 72/26/2 using two blessed potion ingredients.
      Using two cursed potions gave 66/31/3 results. This is probably
      within the margin of error for a sample of this size. Therefore
      the B/U/C status of the potion ingredients matters little, if at
      all.</p>
    <p> [6] Calculation of to-hit bonus: start with TwoWeaponCombat *
      0.05. From that, subtract: ((RightWeaponWeight + LeftWeaponWeight)
      / 10 [20 if Ranger Level32+, 40 if Ranger Level50]) - 6; if this
      results in a negative number it's changed to 0. Then there's some
      benefit for all Rangers. Add +2 for Ambidextrous talent.</p>
    <p> [7] Thanks to CheatMan for the following observations: Attempts
      to use Ventriloquism on any undead always fail. Attempts to use
      Ventriloquism against constructs may succeed, but they do not
      react to it. Ventriloquism, unlike Mindcraft, works against all
      insects. Ventriloquism works against all orb guardians and Keriax.</p>
    <p> [8] DV, PV, to-hit, damage, +/-{Attribute}, and prefix/suffix,
      modify the appraised status compared to standard version of the
      item in question. Exception are wands, which are always at least
      mediocre and improve solely based on number of charges.</p>
    <p> [9] There is one area in the game where this skill is actually
      useful - the Gremlin Cave (<a href="#2.10">2.10</a>).</p>

    <h4>0.4.3 Non-guaranteed ways of acquiring skills</h4>
    Potions and scrolls of education grant knowledge towards a random
    skill. 11 tries are made to select a skill which is not already at
    100. The chosen skill is then granted at or increased by
    6d5/4d5/2d5, depending on B/U/C. Skills can also be wished for; the
    exceptions are Alertness and Healing.
    <p> Potions of training increase the advancement rank of a random
      skill, by 2/1/-1 B/U/C. It is guaranteed that a skill not at 4d5
      and not at 100 will be chosen if such a skill exists.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.4.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.4.4 Training skills</h4>
    In the sense meant for the sake of the following table, "training"
    means actions that will cause a skill to spontaneously increase, <i>without</i>
    the player deciding to increase skill proficiency when gaining an
    experience level. This is different from Yergius' training, which
    can change the potential maximum for a skill (how high the PC can
    raise it) and the dice roll (how fast the PC can get it there). The
    value of Yergius' training can only be taken advantage of when
    gaining an experience level or after successfully applying the skill
    elsewhere in the game.

    <h4>0.4.5 Class aptitudes</h4>
    Each class has different proficiencies at skills, reflected in the
    initial advancement scheme (section <a href="#0.1.4.1.2">0.1.4.1</a>)
    and in the advancement rank. Take, for instance, a Fighter's Courage
    skill. This is in the 3d3 (rank 5) column, so, at 45 skill his
    Courage will be advancable by [+3d3] at a time. If it is less than
    40, the advancement dice will be 3d4 (rank 6), if it is 50 or more,
    then advancement dice will be only 2d4 (rank 4). Advancement dice
    moves one column for every multiple of 10 crossed. However, the
    advancement dice will never go below the rank-specific minimum, in
    this case 1d3 (rank 2).
    <p> Typefaces are used to indicate skill relevance. Bold skills are
      guaranteed to the class; italic ones are easily available (race,
      or in some cases random chance), and plain ones can only be
      obtained in game.</p>

    <h4>0.4.6 Skill mechanics</h4>
    <b>Skill checks</b>
    <p> When your skill value controls your chances of success at
      something, it's called a skill check. Every skill check in ADOM
      has a difficulty class, typically on the order of 120. A die with
      the difficulty class sides is rolled. If it comes up maximum,
      there is automatic failure; otherwise, you succeed if your skill
      value is at least as high as the rolled number (so rolling 1 means
      automatic success).</p>
    <p> For some skills (in the manual marked with '+'), the die may be
      rolled multiple times - twice at 80+ skill, three times at 100.
      The lowest (best for you) result is taken. Note that this nearly
      eliminates the automatic failure chance.</p>
    <p> The Stealthy and Mechanically Inclined talents reduce difficulty
      class by 10%. Eg. if you would be comparing Stealth or Disarm
      Traps against 1d400, compare it against 1d360 instead.</p>
    <p> Successful skill checks give 1 + floor(Le / 20) points of active
      training (see below). Note the discontinuity at Le values
      divisible by 20.</p>
    <p> <b>Variables associated with skills</b></p>
    <p> There are 3 semi-hidden variables associated with each skill: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>First is your skill advancement rank. This corresponds loosely
        to your increase dice, however, it extends in both directions.
        You could have an advancement rank of one rank beyond 4d5 (this
        is rank 10) - this would result in 4d5, but the next time your
        dice decreases, it would stay 4d5 (but now rank 9). Skill
        advancement automatically decreases by one rank each time your
        skill value crosses a multiple of 10. </li>
      <li>Second and third are the training counters. The two training
        counters, taken together, determine the amount by which you can
        raise your skill; if both are zero or the sum is negative, you
        cannot increase a skill until it has been somehow trained. The
        counters, here called 'active training' and 'inactive training',
        are equivalent except that only active training can lead to
        increases over time. When a skill is increased, voluntarily at
        level up or over time, the training counters are decreased,
        taking first from active and then from inactive. </li>
    </ol>
    <p> <b>Training Over Time</b></p>
    <p> This is what happens every turn when the game checks to see if
      skills get trained up: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A SkillTrainCountdown value is decreased by 1. If it's then
        not 0, nothing happens. </li>
      <li>If SkillTrainCountdown = 0, then (130 - Learning) * 5 + 1d100
        = SkillTrainCountdown. (The higher your Learning is, the more
        often you have a chance to get a skill increase. At 25 Learning
        you'll be roughly 575 turns between checks; At 15, you'll be at
        about 625 turns.) </li>
      <li>For each skill, If 1d(SkillPoints + 10) &gt; SkillPoints,
        proceed. </li>
      <li>If Skill can advance (has material, has positive active
        training, not rank 0, not already at 100), add to skill based on
        advancement rank OR 1d(ActiveTraining), whichever is less (and
        it won't raise over 100 obviously). </li>
      <li>Training is then reduced (active first, as always). </li>
    </ol>
    <p> <b>Increasing Skills at Level ups</b></p>
    <p> Skill increases after level 50, henceforth known as fake levels,
      follow slightly different rules. Take the difference between your
      level 49 and your level 50 experience requirements. You can gain a
      fake level if and only if you have gained that much experience
      since your last levelup (real or fake), and you have at least one
      advancable skill. (This is why skill uses tend to precipitate fake
      levels.)</p>
    <p> On real levels only, you have a chance to increase your skill
      advancement rank. The chance of it happening is (total training)
      in 1000 for each skill. Improvement cannot occur if you are
      already at 100, or already have 4d5 or better dice advancement, or
      are lacking skill increase materials if applicable. If it does
      occur, a message is only generated if the visible dice changes;
      increasing from one rank to another is hidden if both dice
      modifiers for the ranks are below or at the minimum.</p>
    <p> After this, on real levels, some permanent training is awarded.
      Your advancement rank dice is rolled twice; the greater roll is
      divided by 2 and added as inactive training.</p>
    <p> For the duration of a single levelup (real or fake), some
      temporary training is made available, equal to (for each skill)
      your advancement rank dice, rolled twice taking the larger,
      divided by 2, and adding a 1d4-1. This temporary training is lost
      after the level increase whether it is used or not; this can lead
      to your training going negative. The increase is always added to
      active training.</p>
    <p> You can increase a number of skills starting at 3 and increasing
      by 1 for every 5 Le after 10. Bards receive two bonus increases.
      Level 6+ Bards receive an additional bonus increase. Characters
      born under the sign of the Book, or those under Cup if the (new)
      level is even, receive an additional increase.</p>
    <p> After removing temporary training, training is decayed, reducing
      active training to 3/4 of its prior value and inactive training to
      7/8. Note that training will never decay if you do not gain
      levels.</p>

    Books and scrolls can be <tt>r</tt>ead. Learned spells are cast - <tt>Z</tt>.
    You can also mark learned spells for quick selection via the <tt>:Z</tt>
    command. Mindcraft is invoked by pressing <tt>Ctrl-i</tt>. It only
    works for Mindcrafters though.
    <p> <a name="0.5.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.5.1 Spells</h4>
    There is a description of available spells except Wish in the <a
      href="adomman-J.html#J4">ADOM Manual</a>.
    The range and damage information has been removed from the manual in
    ADOM 1.1.x+. Accordingly they are tabulated below.
    <p> Wizards, Priests, Druids, and Necromancers are 10 times more
      likely to find spellbooks. Paladins 2,5 times.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.5.1.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.5.1.1 Casting</h4>
    Note that spells become more costly to cast (in terms of PP) as the
    number of available castings decreases. Thus a spell will increase
    in cost as the number of available castings decreases below 100 or
    so, becoming very noticeable as the number drops below about 30.
    This is class dependent but will affect all classes to differing
    extents. Note also that the number of available castings is not a
    simple "decrement by one each time the spell is cast" type of
    formula. Again depending on class, the difficulty of casting the
    spell and probably other factors this will vary. For example,
    casting Light with 1000 castings available to a level 40 Wizard may
    decrease the available castings by one, while casting Death Ray with
    20 castings available with a level 30 Archer may reduce the
    available castings to zero. These are purely hypothetical examples
    but should give an idea of the trends.
    <p> <a name="0.5.1.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.5.1.2 Ball spells</h4>
    Ball spells are extraordinarily useful since no monsters shrug them
    off. They are wonderful when the PC is surrounded, of course. It is
    worth switching to Coward tactics and waiting to be completely
    surrounded before casting. Since they are relatively costly in terms
    of PP, it is useful to destroy the maximum number of enemies with
    each casting. Fire magic is particularly effective against
    cold-based creatures and undead including mummies. Cold magic is
    particularly effective against fire-based creatures. The diameter of
    ball spells is dependent upon Willpower / 8. However, this diameter
    only increases as a multiple of sixteen since ball spells radiate
    symmetrically; the minimum diameter is two. Therefore getting
    Willpower to 24, for instance, does not increase the diameter.
    Willpower must be increased to 32 for the diameter to increase to
    four, 48 for the diameter to increase to six, 64 for the diameter to
    increase to eight, 80 for diameter of 10, and 96 for diameter of 12.
    <p> <a name="0.5.1.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.5.1.3 Wish</h4>
    Wish is a unique spell. It is very difficult to learn, probably
    impossible if the PC has teleportitis. Such PCs must travel to a
    location where teleportation is impossible, such as the the
    Assassin's Guild, the Tomb of the High Kings or the elemental
    temples (the desirability is in that order due to background
    corruption in all of those locations). Furthermore, PCs will usually
    reach Starving! status while attempting to learn Wish. Tactics to
    deal with this include eating a blessed stomafillia to become
    Bloated, waiting just until the PC returns to Satiated, then eating
    another blessed stomafillia. It may be necessary to drink additional
    satiating potions, such as potions of toughness or potential
    toughness, even when the double blessed stomafillia tactic is used.
    Alternatively, PCs without teleportitis can use a room that has the
    "rich flavour" special effect, where PCs will never become hungry.
    Wish is extraordinarly expensive to cast and also drains a random
    attribute -10 when cast. If the PC must cast it, be prepared for the
    attribute drain. Plan to cast it in a special room that lowers spell
    costs, and on Silvernight or Darknight, if possible, according to
    the PC's alignment.
    <p> <a name="0.5.1.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.5.1.4 Other spells</h4>
    Bless damages undead. Healing spells can be cast at monsters
    including companions (but don't use them on slaves!). Lightning,
    Magic Missile, Stun Ray and Death Ray bolts will bounce off the
    walls, but not doors. Nothing is resistant to a Magic Missile. Magic
    Lock will close and lock a door in one turn. Anywhere Earthquake
    generates rocks will be turned into a normal ground tile - this can
    be used to destroy water tiles and make them passable. Some spell
    durations stack. Bless, Strength of Atlas, Invisibility and Farsight
    all stack. Calm Monster doesn't work on monsters generated in
    tension rooms, threat rooms and vaults. It just results in "The
    [monster] ignores your spell". In addition, arena opponents and
    Keethrax' animals won't be affected by the Calm Monster spell.

    <h4>0.5.1.5 Learning spells mechanics</h4>
    <b>Book charges</b>
    <p> Books start with 2d3 charges and disappear when it reaches 0.
      The number charges left is hidden to the player. Successfully
      reading a book deducts one charge.</p>
    <p> <b>Learning spells</b></p>
    <p> Reading a spellbook takes 3 + Cost turns, succeed or fail.
      "Shelves of books" room effect halves this time. There are 11
      possible bonuses to learning a spell: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>We start off with class. Priests and Wizards have +30,
        Mindcrafters -40, other classes in between. </li>
      <li>Learning is counted in next; +1/8*Le for Barbarians, +3*Le for
        Wizards, and in between for others. </li>
      <li>Next comes the difficulty based on the specific spellbook
        (Darkness and Light are lowest with +6, Wish is highest -100). </li>
      <li>Pure spellcasters (except Elementalists) attempting to learn
        purely arcane spells get -10, other combinations get +10. </li>
      <li>You are penalized -1 per remaining turn of drunkenness. </li>
      <li>You are rewarded +20 for a blessed book and penalized -20 for
        cursed. </li>
      <li>You are rewarded for your level. Pure spellcasters get
        +Min(75,2*level). All other non-Mindcrafter non-Trolls get
        +1*level. Mindcrafters and Troll non-casters get nothing. </li>
      <li>+Concentration/5. </li>
      <li>+Literacy/10. </li>
      <li>Druids and Necromancers receive +40 for their specific
        starting book, lightning bolt and frost bolt, respectively. </li>
      <li>Characters born under Book receive +20. </li>
    </ol>
    <p> All of this combines together for some kind of BaseValue. Now
      you choose whether to cast or read the book. If you read it,
      there's a straight up Literacy roll. Basically, your Literacy
      skill is a percentage chance of successfully reading the book. If
      you fail the check, you "cannot decipher the runes" and nothing
      else happens (even with 100 Literacy there is 1% chance of
      automatic failure). Now if BaseValue &gt; 1d100 you succeed in
      learning the spell. Otherwise, you fail. SuccessMargin =
      BaseValue-1d100 previously rolled.</p>
    <p> <b>On success</b></p>
    <p> You gain castings and train Learning. Learning training is
      2*Cost, or Cost/2 if you had some castings already.</p>
    <p> If ExistingCastings &lt; 30, then CastingsGained = Min(200 +
      Le*4, Max(20, Max(5, SuccessMargin - ExistingCastings) * Max(1,
      Le/4))); else CastingsGained = Max(5, Max(1, Le/8) *
      SuccessMargin).</p>
    <p> CastingsGained is then reduced by ExistingCastings and level -
      CastingsGained *= (100 - 3 * (ExistingCastings/50 + lvl/3)) / 100.
      Reduction is never worse than 25% of previous value and never
      reduces CastingsGained below 1.</p>
    <p> Next, Cup is +20% CastingsGained, Good and Great Book Learner
      talents are each +10%.</p>
    <p> <b>On failure</b></p>
    <p> If you fail to read the book successfully, it depends on
      SuccessMargin (negative in this case) plus a base value for each
      class (shown below) your chances of the book doing something nasty
      versus your chances to just not learning anything. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>50 - Wizard, Elementalist </li>
      <li>40 - Priest, Necromancer </li>
      <li>35 - Healer </li>
      <li>30 - Bard, Druid </li>
      <li>25 - Paladin, Ranger </li>
      <li>20 - Thief, Assassin, Monk, Weaponsmith, Beastfighter,
        Merchant </li>
      <li>15 - Fighter, Archer </li>
      <li>10 - Farmer </li>
      <li>-10 - Mindcrafter </li>
      <li>-20 - Barbarian </li>
    </ul>
    <p> If the value is now positive, nothing happens. Otherwise, you
      get a random penalty from the 11 equally probable effects:</p>

    <p> <b>Summary</b></p>
    <p> To sum up, chance of successfuly learning a spell predominantly
      depends on class (pretty self explanatory to the extent
      spellcasters read better). Also birthsign (Book helps), whether
      you're drunk, the difficulty of the spellbook, whether you're a
      Mindcrafter/Troll, B/U/C status of the spellbook, Learning,
      Concentration, Literacy, and the PC's level factor in - the higher
      of these the better.</p>

    <h4>0.5.2 Writing scrolls</h4>
    Scrolls can be written if the PC is literate, has seen an example of
    the scroll, has a magical writing set and a blank scroll to write
    on. Blank scrolls can be found in the dungeons (usually an unlabeled
    scroll, although this is not guaranteed), or they can be created by
    dipping other scrolls into <i>normal</i> water - not holy water or
    unholy water. Be aware that the cost for writing scrolls of chaos
    resistance is high - there is a permanent loss of two or three Mana
    points for <i>Wizards</i>, apparently depending on the blessed vs
    uncursed status of the magical writing set. The Mana cost for
    non-wizards is significantly higher, ten Mana points is typical. In
    addition, any combination of a blessed MWS with an uncursed blank
    scroll or an uncursed MWS with a blessed or uncursed blank scroll
    will result in a loss of hitpoints. This loss ranged from 70 to 145
    HP with a WADOMF'd experience level one Wizard PC. The HP loss may
    go down with increasing experience level for Wizards, but this has
    not been tested. The HP consequences for non-wizards may be more
    dramatic (i.e. deadly).
    <p> Writing other scrolls does not have such drastic consequences,
      though the exact effects have yet to be worked out. Scrolls which
      are particularly hard to write (in order of decreasing difficulty)
      include: scroll of chaos resistance (*10 Mana cost), scroll of
      education (*7), scroll of protection/defense (*6), scroll of
      increase melee accuracy/damage (*5), scroll of item creation (*4).
      Monks don't lose Mana when creating scrolls. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using Blessed equipment reduces the cost (both scroll and
        writing set). Cursed equipment increases it. </li>
      <li>If Literacy &lt; 1d130 the cost is increased; later you need
        to pass a straight Literacy roll to succeed at writing at all. </li>
      <li>Wizards get a difficulty reduction here (halved, before scroll
        type is factored in). </li>
      <li>Monks don't suffer the negative effects of writing a difficult
        scroll like other classes do. Wizards and Priests suffer the
        effects less than others (/2, /4). </li>
      <li>Writing scrolls costs PP, and if your PP is too low you'll
        take damage. </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>0.5.3.1 Confusion blast</h4>
    Note that Confusion Blast, available to experience level one
    Mindcrafters, works analoguously to Ventriloquism (see section <a
      "#0.4"="">0.4</a>). It confuses a monster who then does not alert
    other monsters on the level. It has a range of 3 + (Willpower +
    Level) / 8 squares. If it hits an undead monster, the PC takes 4d4
    damage (4d4/2 at level 50) and no further effect. Mindless monsters,
    including insects and the Eternal Guardian, are immune, as are all
    unlife. Corrupting monsters will corrupt the PC as for a single
    melee hit (divided by 4 at level 32); however they ARE affected
    normally. The monster will not be affected if it passes a spell
    resistance save with an attack power of Level. If it is affected, it
    will be confused for Level + 1dWi-1 turns.

    <h4>0.6.1 Increasing attributes</h4>
    It is to any PC's advantage to raise attributes to the potential
    maximum and beyond. There are several ways to do this. Attributes
    may be increased to their potential maximum (and beyond) naturally
    by training the attribute.

    <p> The Athletics skill also helps raise physical attributes (St,
      Dx, To) more quickly and has a half effect on Appearance. It
      trains twice as fast if attribute &lt; 10, and three times as fast
      if attribute &lt; 5. It happens at only level up, basic effect is
      skill level x 100.</p>
    <p> <b>Training explained</b></p>
    <p> Training value is associated with every attribute, ranging from
      -5000 to 5000. Natural training happens once in 500-1000 turns,
      and always at level up. Every level up trains every attribute by
      level if it's not at potential max. If St &lt; 10, train by 100 at
      level up, if &lt; 5 another 100. Also with Toughness.</p>
    <p> There is a chance that the attribute will be increased or
      decreased on each check. No training occurs if Training=0, if
      Training&gt;0 then an attribute increase is possible, otherwise an
      attribute decrease is possible.</p>
    <p> If the attribute isn't at maximum (or Training is negative),
      number from 1 to N is rolled randomly, and if abs(Training) &gt;
      RolledNumber, then the attribute is increased or decreased. It
      means the smaller N, the bigger chance for an attribute change. If
      Learning &gt; 9 (or Training is negative), N = X * (attribute+10),
      otherwise N = X * (attribute+20-Le). X=50 if Training is positive,
      X=10 if negative; it means negative training generates 5 times
      smaller N, thus is 5 times more effective. If the attribute was
      increased, Training is decreased by 1000 points, but not below
      zero. If an attribute decrease occured, Training is set to 0.</p>
    <p> If the attribute is at its potential (and Training is positive),
      or it is not at potential but 1/10 chance, (another) number from 1
      to attributePotential*100+750 is rolled randomly. If Training &gt;
      RolledNumber, then the attribute potential goes up and Training is
      decreased by (another) 2000 points, but not below 0.</p>
    <p> Finally, another 1000 points of Training are removed, not below
      0. To sum up, PC loses 1000 points of Training on unsuccessfull
      check, 2000 on attribute increase, 3000 on potential increase, and
      4000 on attribute and potential increase.</p>

    <h4>0.6.1.2 Training with Garth</h4>
    The dwarven weaponmaster Garth, found in Dwarftown, can be paid to
    increase attributes other than Appearance and Mana.
    <p> See section <a href="#3.5.5">3.5.5</a> for a bit more
      detail on training with Garth.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.6.1.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.6.1.3 Training attributes with herbs <tt>"</tt></h4>
    Two of the herbs can be used in order to increase attributes to a
    maximum of about 25-27 per attribute. These are:
    <ul>
      <li>Morgia root - Willpower and Toughness (eat)
        <p> Morgia Root trains Toughness up to 25, 5d100+200; trains
          Willpower up to 25, 50d10. B/U/C <i>doesn't matter</i>. About
          18 are needed to guarantee Willpower increase, however usually
          about 8 is enough. </p>
      </li>
      <li>Moss of mareilon - Dexterity (use)
        <p> Using Moss of Mareilon trains Dexterity up to 25, Cursed:
          -10d100, Uncursed: 10d100, Blessed: 60d30+30. About 6 blessed
          patches are needed to maximize chances for increase. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <b>Tip:</b> when your Wi/To attributes or your Dx attribute is
      24 and the natural maximum is greater than 24 (in other words,
      when one more increase would put you to 25), use all of the morgia
      and not cursed moss of marelion you can, since once you hit 25,
      the herbs become useless. But if you pack on the training at 24,
      you may still get another increase or two after you hit 25, from
      the remainder.</p>
    <p> In any case, do not eat or use additional herbs until the
      attribute increases have taken effect - this may take a while.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.6.1.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.6.1.4 Increasing attributes by eating corpses <tt>%</tt></h4>
    Many corpses have an affect on attributes. Some simply increase a
    given attribute, others will increase one attribute while decreasing
    another. Some have a limit, that is, they will only increase an
    attribute to a certain number, after which they will have no effect.
    Others affect attributes regardless of their value.
    <p> For example, spellcaster corpses have 17% probability of
      granting +1 Ma, except for kobold shaman corpse, which always
      grants +1 Ma, but also causes sickness. Refer to section <a
        "#0.3.3"="">0.3.3</a> for the other effects resulting from
      eating monster corpses.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.6.1.5"></a></p>
    <h4>0.6.1.5 Increasing attributes with potions <tt>!</tt></h4>
    There are five kinds of potions that increase or decrease the PC's
    attributes directly: potions of -attribute-, potions of potential
    -attribute-, potions of boost -attribute-, potions of gain
    attributes and potions of carrot juice. Rearranging attributes is
    dealt with below.
    <p> Potions of -attribute- behave as follows: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uncursed potion of -attribute-: an uncursed potion of
        -attribute- will increase the value of -attribute- by one, and
        increases the potential maximum plus one. </li>
      <li>Blessed potion of -attribute- : a blessed potion of
        -attribute- will increase the value of -attribute- by two, and
        increases the potential maximum plus two. </li>
      <li>Cursed potion of -attribute- : a cursed potion of -attribute-
        will decrease the value of -attribute- by one, and decreases the
        potential maximum by one. The effect of cursed potions of
        -attribute- and cursed potions of potential -attribute- is worse
        if the PC is cursed and/or doomed. -2 points if you're cursed,
        -3 if doomed, -4 if both. </li>
      <li>Potions of potential -attribute- do the same with your
        attribute potential, which determines the natural maximum of
        your PC in that attribute. </li>
      <li>Potions of boost -attribute- work like potions of -attribute-,
        but give a bigger boost that is <i>temporary</i>. These are
        useful when you need to get some attribute over a certain limit,
        such as the Wi: 32 border that allows for bigger ball spells.
        Another useful application is to use potions of boost learning
        just before a level increase, which will probably boost learning
        enough to increase the number of skill increases allowed. </li>
      <li>Potions of gain attributes raise the value of a single
        attribute by one if uncursed or all attributes by one if
        blessed. Note that they do not raise potential maximums. They
        only increase potential maximums to the resulting value of
        -attribute-, when necessary. </li>
      <li>Potions of carrot juice can be used to increase Perception.
        Drinking a blessed potion of carrot juice will increase
        Perception by +1. Drinking an uncursed potion of carrot juice
        may increase Perception if the Pe score is very low; this needs
        to be tested. After 20, it becomes more difficult to raise
        Perception with blessed potions of carrot juice. When Perception
        is below 20, the message "Your eyesight seems to improve!" is
        generated. Above 20, the message is absent even if Perception is
        increased. There is a special room effect "The air of this room
        is filled with the smell of carrots." which will cause a
        one-time +5 increase to Perception when a potion of carrot juice
        is consumed while in the room. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.6.1.6"></a></p>
    <h4>0.6.1.6 Crystals of knowledge <tt>*</tt></h4>
    <tt>U</tt>sing crystals of knowledge has two possible effects: if
    the crystal is uncursed, a bit of the level layout around the PC is
    revealed. If the crystal is blessed, a 1d2 increase to the Learning
    attribute may also occur. In ADOM 1.0.0+, there is a limit similar
    to that encountered with herbs: Learning increase mostly fails
    around 25 - 27 or so with blessed crystals of knowledge.
    <p> <a name="0.6.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.6.2 Rearranging attributes</h4>
    <a name="0.6.2.1"></a>
    <h4>0.6.2.1 Potions of exchange <tt>!</tt></h4>
    Drinking a potion of exchange changes your attributes, not taking
    into account any effects from corruption or equipment. A cursed
    potion of exchange swaps six attributes randomly, an uncursed one
    twists five, and a blessed one swaps two attributes around.
    <p> <a name="0.6.2.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.6.2.2 Potions of balance <tt>!</tt></h4>
    Potions of balance can be very, very helpful if you know how to use
    them. When you drink one, the game calculates the average of all of
    your attributes, rounds it down, and adds a number depending on the
    potion's status. For a blessed potion, it's +3, uncursed 0, and
    cursed -3. The attribute changes are based on this final score.
    <p> If an attribute exceeds this score, it's lowered by one. If it's
      below this, it's raised by one. If it's equal, it remains
      unchanged.</p>
    <p> Therefore, if you have a well-rounded character, with most or
      all attribute scores close to each other and drink a blessed
      potion of balance, you will get a boost to most or all attributes.</p>
    <p> However, this only happens with 100-4*(attributeAverage-10) %
      chance. This means 100% chance for attribute averages of 10, 0%
      for 35. The B/U/C status of the potion is counted towards that
      attributeAverage as explained earlier. Otherwise, alignment is
      moved towards neutrality instead.</p>
    <p> Note also that potions of balance take into account all
      attribute-modifying elements including worn equipment, wielded
      equipment and corruptions.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.6.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.6.3 Increasing attributes beyond their usual limits</h4>
    Certain afflictions will lower attributes. While suffering from
    these, the PC can take advantage of this fact to increase her
    attributes. Once the affliction wears off or is removed, the
    attribute will recover and exceed the usual limit.
    <p> <b>Sickness:</b> -2 to several attributes; -5 to Toughness</p>
    <p> <b>Starvation:</b> -4 to Strength as soon as Starving status is
      reached. As time passes, Strength, Learning, Willpower and
      Dexterity begin dropping. They will eventually reach half their
      starting value (Strength reaches half the value after the
      immediate -4). While the attributes are dropping, the PC is not in
      danger of starving to death. When the attributes reach the halfway
      point, the PC is in danger of dying and should eat something.
      Since Starvation halves attributes rather than simply decrementing
      them it is much more powerful than Sickness.</p>
    <p> <b>Rings of weakness:</b> Decreases Strength to 2. Be careful
      to drop the PC's pack (and heavy worn equipment ie. Big Punch)
      before using rings of weakness.</p>
    <p> An extremely convenient scenario for these tactics is mining out
      a level that supports herbs. Morgia roots and moss of mareilon
      train Toughness, Willpower and Dexterity. Stomacemptia can be used
      for Starvation. Mining will generate crystals of knowledge for
      training Learning and Stone Giant corpses for increasing Strength.
      Even better if it is near Dwarftown. Most PCs will not have the
      Mining skill or an artifact pickaxe and will need Glod's help
      repairing pickaxes for 1500 gold pieces. This exploit should raise
      these attributes into the 50s.</p>
    <p> <b>Garth</b> (section <a href="#3.5.5">3.5.5</a>) is a
      potentially endless source of attribute increases for those
      attributes he trains. The limitless gold available from the Casino
      can be used for this.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.6.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.6.4 Luck</h4>
    Luck is a hidden property of the PC, which is not stored anywhere,
    but rolled whenever needed. This Guidebook sometimes references to
    Luck. The following table explains how Luck is calculated.
    <p> </p>

    <p> The actual Luck roll is 1dGoodLuck-1 + BadLuck, where GoodLuck
      are conditions which increase Luck, and BadLuck are conditions
      which decrease luck (last 5 rows from the above table). This gives
      overall positive or negative bonus to the situation. Note that
      being Doomed in itself will also further impact many situations
      beyond the Luck roll penalty above.</p>

    The speed system is well covered in the <a

    <p> Monks and Beastfighters also receive speed bonuses as they
      level. Some items such as a quicksilver staff, ring/amulet of
      speed, and the artifacts Black Torc, Ring of the Master Cat and
      Boots of Great Speed can also increase the PC's speed. Corpses of
      monster such as quicklings and claw bugs and potions of quickling
      blood can also increase base speed. Slow Monster spell, boots of
      the slow shuffle, moloch armors, armor of sloth, high burden and
      high satiation can be used to guarantee speed increases from
      corpses, akin to sickness/starvation training for attributes.</p>

    <hr size="2"> <a name="0.7"></a>
    <h3>0.7 Attack</h3>
    PC's ability to successfully attack monsters in melee or missile
    combat is improved via weapon skills. A general description of them
    can be found in the <a
      href="adomman-G.html#G1">ADOM Manual</a>.
    Press <tt>Ctrl-w</tt> to display your current weapon skills.
    Pressing <tt>W</tt> or <tt>M</tt> displays your melee or missile
    weapon statistics, ie. how likely are you to hit and how much damage
    you do with your currently equipped weapon or weapons. By the way,
    to attack with missile, just <tt>t</tt>hrow it. This works for
    thrown daggers and bows alike.
    <p> In general, a PC with higher Strength will do more damage with a
      given weapon. There seems to be one important exception to this:
      whips. As implemented in ADOM, the damage done with whips,
      especially dual-wielded whips, seems to be more dependent on
      Dexterity than Strength. The manual touches on this subject,
      stating that a PC must have high speed to use two whips
      effectively. Dexterity seems to be at least as important.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.7.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.7.1 Jack of all trades or master of one?</h4>
    This is a matter of personal preference and style. The advantage of
    becoming very proficient with one weapon becomes clear from reading
    the manual: bonuses to the to-hit, to-damage, and to DV as well as
    reduced attack cost when using the weapon. There is also the
    possibility of achieving Grand Mastery, where the attack cost is
    reduced to the point where about 1 1/2 attacks per round is
    possible. The downside is also easy to imagine: without an artifact
    weapon in the specialized category, a PC can have the weapon
    destroyed and be without one. In practice this is not usually a
    problem since there are generally plenty of weapons to be found in
    the game. Also, a PC may run across a truly outstanding weapon at
    some point in the game, some of which are guaranteed, and have no
    skill with the weapon. Again, this is not usually a huge problem
    since mid- to high-level PCs will be able to train up their weapon
    skill in any given category relatively quickly.
    <p> Critical hits yield double skill marks. If the PC finds a weapon
      that delivers critical hits, it will train about twice as fast.
      Throwing shield yields shield skill marks. No skill marks are
      gained if fighting using Very Defensive or Coward tactic setting.
      No shield marks are gained on Berserk.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.7.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.7.2 Class considerations - what weapon to specialize in</h4>
    <b>Beastfighters</b> - Beastfighters receive severe penalties for
    using melee weapons, and should avoid doing so for this reason. They
    develop a formidable unarmed attack as they advance in experience
    and Unarmed Combat skill. Note that the penalty does not apply to
    missile weapons; all Beastfighters should practice with missile
    weapons in order to take advantage of -foo- slaying ammunition.
    <p> <b>Mindcrafters</b> - Willpower is critical for Mindcrafters.
      The Sword of Nonnak is a guaranteed artifact sword available to
      most PCs at experience level 15 or less. It grants +5 to
      Willpower. This makes Swords an attractive weapon class for
      Mindcrafters to specialize in, at least during the early game.</p>
    <p> <b>Monks</b> - Monks also receive penalties for using weapons,
      albeit not as severe as Beastfighters, and so should specialize in
      Unarmed Combat. Monks also excel at <tt>k</tt>icking and receive
      a class power that enables them to deliver a circular kick.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.7.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.7.3 Achieving Grand Mastery</h4>
    Grand Mastery is difficult to achieve. It will not happen simply
    from using a single weapon type throughout a normal game. Becoming
    doomed in the wilderness for the frequent wilderness encounters is
    one way of generating an infinite number of enemies to be killed
    with no corruption. The Crown of Science (doubly useful because of
    its +9 bonus to Le) or a ring of doom can be used for this.
    <p> There is one class + starsign combination that can reasonably
      expect to achieve Grand Mastery during a normal game. Note the
      following two manual entries:</p>
    <p> From the Weapon Skills section:</p>
    <p> <b>Farmers</b> are so skilled in the use of polearms that they
      need 20% less marks to increase in their use.</p>
    <p> From the Horoscope section:</p>
    <p> <b>Sword</b> Positive modifiers from Tactics settings are
      increased by 10%, costs to increase melee weapon skills are
      reduced by 20%, +1 to the initial Learning score.</p>
    <p> This double 20% reduction in cost to increase weapon skills
      means that Farmers born in the month of the Sword who use polearms
      exclusively, and do not hurry, can expect to achieve Grand Mastery
      with polearms. This will happen approximately by the time the PC
      reaches the Mana Temple, depending on the ending the PC is going
      for, etc.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.7.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.7.4 True Berserker</h4>
    Any PC except Monks, who wield a weapon without armor (Beastfighter
    is no exception), and switch tactic to Berserk, get a True Berserker
    bonus, which is +10 to hit and damage, in addition to Berserk tactic
    setting bonus. Shields, necklaces, rings, bracers, tools, missiles,
    missile weapons and armor with "of rage" suffix can be worn and the
    PC is still a True Berserker. If the requirements for true
    berserking are met, every melee attack will yield the "You lust for
    blood!" message before hits or misses are displayed. Also, the
    message "Do you really want to attack..." will not be displayed and
    the PC will instantly attack any monster, hostile or not.
    <p> <a name="0.7.5"></a></p>
    <h4>0.7.5 Melee combat</h4>
    <b>To hit</b>
    <p> Stunned gives -4, Blind -4, Bloated -2, Satiated -1, Drunk -1,
      Blessed +2, spear without shield +2, Invisible +4, Dwarven Shield
      and Dwarven Rune Axe paired +10 (axe must be in left hand), Needle
      and Sting +50. Furthermore there is bonus based on Strength:
      +(St-12)/2, +(St-9)/2, only positive bonus is applied. Melee
      Weapon Master talent gives +3, Basher, Powerful Striker, Mighty
      Strike give +1, +2, +3 if weapon weight&gt;=100s, Brawler +2 if
      unarmed. Monks and Beastfighters get additional bonuses if unarmed
      (see <a href="#0.1.4.5">0.1.4.5</a> for details).</p>
    <p> An enraged monster has twice as many attacks as it normally
      would, and has 3 less DV.</p>
    <p> <b>To damage</b></p>
    <p> Torch +1d4 and additional +2d4 vs fire vulnerable, thorns
      corruption +3d3, Assassin or Thief lvl 12+ and backstab *2, of the

    <p> <a name="0.7.6"></a></p>

    <p> <b>To damage</b></p>
    <p> Merchants throwing gold get lvl/2 + 3 more damage.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.7.7"></a></p>
    <h4>0.7.7 Critical hit chances</h4>
    Base chance is 5%, but Luck modifies this slightly. Murderous weapon
    doubles this chance. Then add the following:
    <ul>
      <li>+(FindWeakness/5)% if melee attack </li>
      <li>+(FindWeakness/10)% if missile attack </li>
      <li>+25% if backstabbing </li>
      <li>+10% for lvl 25+ Fighters </li>
      <li>+20% for lvl 25+ Assassins </li>
      <li>+((lvl+10)/1.2) % for Beastfighter vs animal (+10% at level 2,
        +50% at level 50) </li>
      <li>+50% bloody/orcish dagger, +50% whip of slaughtering, +40% Axe
        of the Minotaur Emperor, +30% Serpent's Bite, +0% Grod (bug) </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Due to a bug, Ring of the Master Cat (+16%) and Bracers of War
      (+8%) increase critical chance only if used as melee weapons. <small>Both
        bugs are fixed in v1.2.0.</small></p>

    <h3>0.8 Defense</h3>
    <a name="0.8.1"></a>
    <h4>0.8.1 DV versus PV</h4>
    As everyone knows from reading the <a
      href="adomman-H.html#H3">ADOM Manual</a>,
    DV is an abbreviation for Defensive Value and PV is an abbreviation
    for Protection Value. The former determines how hard it is for an
    opponent to hit the PC; the latter determines how much damage is
    absorbed by a PC's armor if a monster makes a successful hit. In
    recent gammas of ADOM, there has been a tendency for monsters to
    score more critical hits which bypass PV. Some monsters <i>always</i>
    bypass PV, notably claw bugs, which make them very annoying
    opponents for low level characters. Note also that non-artifact
    armor can be damaged by monster attacks, lowering its Protection
    Value especially and eventually destroying it.
    <p> So the question arises, which is better, a high DV or a high PV?
      As with the question of whether to specialize in one weapon or
      become proficient with many weapons, it is largely a matter of
      personal preference and style. There are successful players who
      use both approaches. In practice, it is possible to raise DV to
      the point where none other than the very highest level monsters
      can hit the PC. A DV over 100 means very few monsters will hit the
      PC successfully. However, a DV this high is not available to any
      but the very high level characters that specifically pursue it.
      Likewise, a PV over 100 means few monsters can hurt the PC, since
      the vast majority do not deal over 100 points of damage in one
      round. Bear in mind, however: 1) the possibility of critical hits
      and 2) the possibility of running into something very nasty, such
      as balors, Greater Molochs and the Emperor Moloch which certainly
      <i>do</i> deal over 100 points of damage per round.</p>
    <p> A general rule of thumb? Add up the DV and PV bonuses. A [-3,
      +5] iron chain mail is about as good as a [+0, +2] leather armor
      (and the latter is lighter and won't rust). Few non-artifact
      armors can compete with an average eternium plate mail at [-1,
      +13]. Dragon scale mails averaging [-2, +11] are also extremely
      desirable armors since they grant immunity to the element
      corresponding to the dragon the armor is derived from. On the DV
      side, few non-artifact items can compare to eternium tower shields
      averaging [+13, +4]. Dragon scale mails and eternium tower shields
      are so powerful that many players will use a wish on these items.</p>
    <p> The debate over DV versus PV is one that will never be settled,
      which is as it should be. ;-)</p>
    <p> <a name="0.8.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.8.2 DV bonuses</h4>
    DV is increased based on Dexterity twice, by (Dx-12)/2 and (Dx-9)/2;
    being Drunk decreases DV by 3. High Alertness with Alchemy have also
    positive effect on DV (see section <a href="#0.4">0.4</a>).
    Monks get DV increased by (lvl*2)/3 if not wearing armor except
    specific (blood-stained robe, armor of rage?); Beastfighters by
    lvl/3. Mindcrafter's Mental Shield provides (Level+Wi)/5. PCs
    receive about half DV bonus from unarmed combat when fighting with
    staves.
    <p> <a name="0.8.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.8.3 PV bonuses</h4>

    <h3>0.9 Monsters</h3>
    The <a href="adomman-I.html">ADOM
      Manual</a> has a section about e<tt>x</tt>perience and
    advancement, which is achieved mainly via <tt>:k</tt>illing
    monsters. To see how much a neighbouring monster is injured, use <tt>:w</tt>.
    Another underused ability every PC has is to <tt>:s</tt>wap
    positions with monster. However this mostly does not work with
    hostile monsters. Press <tt>&amp;</tt> to access the monster
    memory.
    <p> <a name="0.9.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.1 Significance of the first kill</h4>
    Many new ADOM players are dismayed to find that they need to know
    what monster their PC killed first. By the time they find this out,
    they have forgotten, of course. Write it down, rename your PC to
    reflect your first kill, do anything necessary to remember that
    first kill. It is very important, especially if you are going to
    attempt an ultra ending.
    <p> <a name="0.9.1.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.1.1 Courage skill</h4>
    There is a description of the Courage skill in the <a
      href="adomman-E.html#Courage">ADOM
      Manual</a>. It is worthwhile to acquire it, although many players
    ignore it and have finished the game without it. The skill is
    obtained by finishing the Old Barbarian's quest: kill an additional
    score (20) of the monster your PC first killed. Note that the Old
    Barbarian will not give the quest to PCs who have chaotic alignment.
    <p> <a name="0.9.1.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.1.2 Filk quest</h4>
    The Filk quest is for very advanced players attempting an ultra
    ending. The quest objective is to find and kill the named quickling
    bard Filk. He can be found in the Infinite Dungeon on the level
    number corresponding to the number of first-kill monsters the PC has
    killed. This will of course be a minimum of 21 if the PC has
    acquired the Courage skill. It can also change during the quest if
    the PC kills additional first-kill monsters after being assigned the
    quest. See section <a href="#4.3.1.1">4.3.1.1</a> for more about
    the Filk quest.
    <p> <a name="0.9.1.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.1.3 Strategy for the first kill: where and what?</h4>
    There are many schools of thought on what the first kill should be.
    If the PC wants to acquire the Courage skill quickly after being
    assigned the Old Barbarian's quest, the monsters should be readily
    available. If the PC also plans to do the Filk quest later in the
    game, the total number of first-killed monsters killed must be
    minimized in order to prevent a tedious and dangerous dive into the
    Infinite Dungeon. Some experienced players will ignore the Old
    Barbarian's quest for the Courage skill. This makes it very easy to
    complete the Filk quest, since if the player has chosen wisely the
    PC will have killed only one of the monsters in question. Some
    players choose to make the first kill in Lawenilothehl for this
    reason. Muggers, for instance, are found only in Lawenilothehl and
    the Assassins' Guild. Skriek, the ratling found in Lawenilothehl, is
    the only cloaked ratling in the game (although killing him means the
    PC can no longer buy keys from him, which can save the PC's life).
    Hotzenplotz, who is also located in Lawenilothehl, is the only crime
    lord in the game. He is not easy for an experience level one PC to
    kill, but it can be done with Wizards who have a good offensive bolt
    spell (not Magic Missile), or Hurthling Archers who start the game
    with level five skill in thrown rocks. Hotzenplotz's guardians
    Grunge and Munge are likewise the only two half-orc bouncers in the
    game.
    <p> If the PC wants the Courage skill and wants to attempt an ultra
      ending, the following requirements must be met: the first kill
      must be a monster readily available after receiving the Old
      Barbarian's quest; it must also be uncommon in the various
      dungeons the PC will face so that the Filk quest does not get out
      of control. Entering the Small Cave at the start of the game and
      killing a rat, kobold or goblin as the first kill, for instance,
      makes it much more difficult to finish an ultra ending.</p>
    <p> Beggars, goodwives, children, and farmers all make good, risk
      free first kills (the alignment drop is pretty negligible). For
      the latter 3, you should lure them out of Terinyo first. Also, if
      you're going for both Courage and the Filk quest, outlaws are <i>excellent</i>
      first kills, since they're rare enough to avoid, but can be easily
      generated on the road by the Pyramid, as well as being guaranteed
      in Lawenilothehl.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.9.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.2 Cats <tt>f</tt> - the significance of felines</h4>
    There are three types of monsters that count as cats in ADOM: cave
    lions, cave tigers and wild cats.
    <p> The Cat Lord resides on D: 35 in the Caverns of Chaos. He
      rewards PCs who have avoided killing any cats with a powerful
      artifact ring. He will be hostile towards PCs that have killed
      cats and becomes more powerful with each cat killed (+10 HP for
      each cat killed, +1 level for each 25 cats killed, max level 20).</p>
    <p> Many players consider the Ring of the Master Cat to be the most
      powerful and desirable ring in the game. It grants +16 to
      Dexterity and +16 to speed. In addition it causes the PC to
      deliver considerably more critical hits with melee and missile
      weapons and grants the Fate smiles intrinsic.</p>
    <p> It is important to remember that even after receiving the ring,
      the PC must not kill any cats while wearing it, since it explodes
      in that circumstance. The ring does not explode if it is in the
      backpack or left on another level when a cat is killed after
      receiving the RotMC.</p>
    <p> Make no mistake about it, the requirement to kill no cats for
      the entire game is a difficult one, causing many to refer to them
      as "those damn cats." The power of the ring makes it worthwhile to
      attempt to avoid killing them.</p>
    <p> There are several ways to deal with cats. Teleportation is one,
      from a wand or spell. Either teleport the cat away, especially if
      the PC does not have teleport control, or teleport the PC. Potions
      of exchange thrown at a cat will turn it into another monster.
      Potions of raw chaos, available at any time once the PC has Moon
      Sickle, will turn cats into writhing masses of primal chaos when
      thrown at cats. Cats can be led over traps until they are killed
      or turned into a writhing mass of primal chaos. Luring a cat
      across an alarm trap causes other monsters to become hostile and
      attack the cat. Note that in newer versions of ADOM, the PC is
      charged with killing a cat if he creates or sets off a trap that
      kills a cat. Wands of destruction can be used to safely kill cats
      since monsters "destroyed" in this way do not appear in the kill
      list.</p>
    <p> PCs that are near Dwarftown can bring cats to Dwarftown and have
      the Priest, for instance, kill them. This is probably a bit
      dangerous, since bringing hostile monsters into Dwarftown
      repeatedly may eventually result in some of the inhabitants
      becoming hostile. It should also be possible for PCs near the
      Banshee's level to bring cats to her level and have her wail kill
      them. Additional monsters that can be used include vortices. Lure
      a cat close enough to one and allow it to explode. Be familiar
      with vortices before trying this.</p>
    <p> Companions can kill cats for you. Cave lions and wild cats can
      be tamed with rat and/or giant rat corpses, if you have enough of
      them. Cave tigers can eventually be tamed with pieces of fresh
      and/or raw meat, but it requires five or more pieces. If the PC
      can become invisible, and has not attacked the cat in question, it
      can simply be walked away from. Cats can be confused with the
      Ventriloquism skill. While they are confused, run away. Cats can
      probably be confused or blinded by throwing potions of confusion
      or blindness at them. Again the run away tactic would be used.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.9.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.3 Karmic beings</h4>
    Karmic monsters come in three main varieties: karmic lizards <tt>l</tt>,
    (ancient) karmic (baby) dragons <tt>D</tt> and named great karmic
    wyrms <tt>W</tt>. They can be identified by the fact that they
    change color with each turn. Be very careful if the PC encounters a
    lizard with the <tt>w</tt>alk command. It may allow the PC to wind
    up right next to the lizard, in which case you may not have time to
    notice the color change. Karmics demand caution because attacking
    them in melee causes the PC to lose the Fate smiles intrinsic, then
    the Lucky intrinsic followed by cursing then dooming if the PC
    continues. This is not a 100% guaranteed effect. PCs can kill
    karmics in one hit and not suffer the consequences. However, it
    happens so often that karmics should not be engaged in melee if it
    is possible to avoid it. Killing them with magic, missiles,
    Mindcraft or companions is the way to dispatch them. The changing
    color of karmics reflects the nature of karmic dragons. They breathe
    not one element, like ordinary dragons, but have <i>all</i> the
    breath attacks available, varying from turn to turn depending on
    their color. This also means that they are immune to all elemental
    magical attacks. Unfortunately karmic dragon scale mail is not
    available in the game. ;-) They are vulnerable to dragon slaying
    ammo.
    <p> Three unique beings share the cursing/dooming property of
      karmics: Filk, the quickling bard, the Oracle, and Sharad-Waador,
      the ancient karmic wyrm.</p>
    <p> Karmic beings will occasionally leave corpses when killed.
      Eating the corpse of a karmic being will, in order, remove the
      Doomed intrinsic if present, remove the Cursed intrinsic if
      present, grant the Lucky intrinsic if not present and grant the
      Fate smiles intrinsic if not present. Remember all or any of these
      intrinsics can be present simultaneously. Thus a PC that is Doomed
      and Lucky would lose the Doomed intrinsic and retain the Lucky
      intrinsic after eating a karmic corpse. The same is true for a PC
      that has the Cursed and Doomed intrinsics - the PC would lose the
      Doomed intrinsic but not the Cursed intrinsic and would not gain
      either the Lucky or Fate smiles intrinsics.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.9.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.4 Monster types</h4>
    Each monster is typically categorized based on attributes relating
    to the monster's race, body type etc. Each monster shares certain
    attributes with other monsters in the same category, usually
    including a common vulnerability to certain weapons (such as
    missiles "of -foo- slaying"). Such categories are commonly referred
    to as monster types, or mob types. Listed below are all the known
    monster types in ADOM. Note that a number of known monsters do not
    appear to belong to any of these categories; rather, their monster
    type can be said to be "Unknown". Examples are eyes <tt>e</tt>,
    most fantastic beasts <tt>F</tt>, unicorns <tt>U</tt>, mimics <tt>m</tt>,
    rust monsters <tt>R</tt>, will o'wisp <tt>*</tt>, and living wall
    <tt>#</tt>. Furthermore, it is possible for a monster to fall into
    more than one category, eg. golems are construct humanoids,
    skeletons, zombies, liches etc. are undead humanoids, and Andor
    Drakon is a demonic humanoid.
    <p> <a name="0.9.4.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.4.1 Animals</h4>
    Animals are a diverse mixture of semi-intelligent monsters, which
    usually can be affected by mindcraft (with the exception of a few
    such as rabid dogs), but can't use equipment and tend not speak in a
    comprehensible language. The monster class consists of several
    monsters including bats <tt>B</tt>, natural beasts such as bears <tt>N</tt>,
    fantastic beasts <tt>F</tt>, lizards <tt>l</tt>, snakes <tt>s</tt>,
    and worms <tt>w</tt>.
    <p> Regarding animals: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>There are no known weapons that slay all animals. </li>
      <li>Beastfighters attacking animals in unarmed melee have a
        greater chance of landing critical hits on them than against any
        other type of monsters. </li>
      <li>All animals can be calmed and eventually tamed by music. </li>
      <li>If the PC is a Druid, all animals in the game will be
        generated non-hostile. The main exception to this is in the evil
        druid Keethrax's lair in the Druid Dungeon. </li>
      <li>Additionally, if the PC is a Druid it is a major offence to
        their god(s) to sacrifice an animal. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> The following are animal subtypes: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Aquatics <tt>A</tt></b> - underwater creatures found in
        the Water Dragon Cave, they have a speed bonus while in water. </li>
      <li><b>Cats <tt>f</tt></b> - see section 0.9.2 above. </li>
      <li><b>Dogs <tt>d</tt></b> - can be tamed by <tt>g</tt>iving
        them bones. </li>
      <li><b>Rats <tt>r</tt></b> - the artifact weapon Cat's Claw slays
        them; they are potent swimmers. </li>
      <li><b>Insects </b> - ants <tt>a</tt>, bees <tt>b</tt>,
        centipedes <tt>c</tt>, and bugs <tt>i</tt> - artifact weapon
        ebony spear "Bugbiter" slays them all; they are immune to
        mindcraft (except giant ant warrior, giant ant queen, giant bee
        queen, giant bee warrior and ankheg). Almost all insect corpses
        provide intrinsics or other special effects. They are also
        largely indigestible and cause the PC to vomit, losing
        satiation. </li>
      <li><b>Spiders <tt>S</tt></b> - are not classified as insects,
        but are a separate animal subtype. Obviously, they are
        poisonous, and they ignore webs. Except tarantulas, spiders also
        spin webs. </li>
      <li><b>Rabbits <tt>r</tt></b> - they only appear on special
        Battle Bunny level, deep in the CoC. Rabbit knife slays them. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.9.4.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.4.2 Constructs <tt>Y</tt></h4>
    Constructs, or unlife, are insentient or semi-sentient monsters,
    that are damaged and destroyed by attacks rather than injured and
    killed. The main types of monsters belonging to the construct/unlife
    category are golems <tt>Y</tt>, and construct humanoids such as
    gargoyles and margoyles <tt>I</tt>. Vortices <tt>V</tt>,
    elementals <tt>E</tt>, grues <tt>x</tt>, and animated armors <tt>[</tt>
    are also constructs.
    <p> Regarding constructs:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Amulet of protection from constructs protects against their
        special attacks 60% / 80% / 120% of the time B/U/C. It does not
        protect against explosion of a vortex. </li>
      <li>Unlife slayers in the game include arrows/quarrels "of
        construct slaying"; and a small number of artifact weapons
        including Purifier and Vanquisher. </li>
      <li>Note that although the game most often uses the term
        "constructs" to refer to the monster type, weapons that slay
        constructs display the line "It is an unlife slayer." when
        Greater Identify is applied to them. </li>
      <li>Mindcraft and stethoscopes can not be used on constructs. </li>
      <li>They never panic or become enraged. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.9.4.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.4.3 Demons <tt>&amp;</tt></h4>
    Demons are uncommon monsters that include some of the most powerful
    monsters in the game. Apart from molochs and least daemons, most
    demons have corrupting attacks and/or magical powers such as an
    elemental breath weapon. Almost all members of the demon monster
    type are represented by the <tt>&amp;</tt> symbol; though some
    monsters such as grues <tt>x</tt>, imps and quasits <tt>I</tt>,
    and chaos knights <tt>h</tt> also belong to the group. The category
    includes all elemental demons, molochs, greater molochs, balors,
    greater demons; and all the fearsome artifact guardians, the Emperor
    Moloch, the Greater Balor, and Andor Drakon.
    <p> Demons are vulnerable to the aptly named arrows/quarrels of
      demon slaying. Additionally, several artifact weapons in the game
      slay demons: the Trident of the Red Rooster, the Rune-covered
      Trident, Executor, Purifier and Vanquisher. Furthermore, blessed
      weapons deal 1.5 times their base damage to demons.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.9.4.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.4.4 Dragons <tt>D</tt></h4>
    This monster type consists solely of monsters represented by the
    letter <tt>D</tt> or <tt>W</tt> - dragons and wyrms. All dragons
    have breath attacks, whilst wyrms have extra magical attacks too.
    Nearly all dragons are associated with an element; with the
    exception of karmic dragons (which harness all elements), water
    dragons (water isn't an element in the game, per se), and shadow
    wyrms (which harness undead powers). Also, most dragons are chaotic,
    with the exception of Sharad-Waador and the water dragons.
    <p> Regarding dragons: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>They are vulnerable to any weapon (greater) identified as "a
        dragon slayer". These include arrows/quarrels of dragon slaying,
        and the artifact weapons Wyrmlance and Vanquisher. </li>
      <li>A number of dragons yield a small alignment boost when killed.
        Of course, this only includes dragons that are chaotic to begin
        with, and does not include baby dragons. </li>
      <li>Colored dragons and wyrms can be enraged by giving them a
        dragon-hide item that is the same color as them. They will also
        instantly destroy the item. There is, of course, usually very
        little reason to actually do this. Due to a bug black and white
        dragons react to the opposite color when you give them items
        like this, instead of their own. </li>
      <li>Dragons have a unique characteristic when killed: a dragon
        that has picked up gold pieces will drop twice as many when
        killed, in addition to whatever gold and other treasure it may
        have been carrying. This is probably a bug and can obviously be
        used to multiply the PC's gold potentially indefinitely once he
        is buff enough to dispatch dragons. There is some risk involved
        since many types of dragons can destroy entire heaps of gold
        with their breath attacks. Note that the amount of gold in a
        single stack is limited to a 32-bit integer (2<sup>31</sup> - 1
        or 2,147,483,647). Generating larger stacks will cause errors. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.9.4.5"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.4.5 Giants <tt>H</tt></h4>
    Interestingly, various monsters whose name begins with the "giant"
    adjective are <i>not</i> giants at all - such as giant rat, giant
    rust monster etc. On the other hand, monsters with "giant" not as
    the first word are in fact giants - such as hill giant, fire giant
    king or frost giant jarl. Giants also include titans, cyclops, and
    the ettin <tt>O</tt>. As one can imagine, great physical strength
    is of course a common attribute amongst giants, as is their
    corresponding ability to grant the PC some extra Strength when
    eaten. Also, most giants use missile weapons. When a titan (or
    moloch) is approaching, you will hear "*THUMB*". Weapons which slay
    giants are only arrow/quarrel of giant slaying, Grod and Vanquisher.
    <p> <a name="0.9.4.6"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.4.6 Humanoids <tt>@</tt></h4>
    Humanoids are a diverse class of monsters that are at least
    semi-intelligent, capable of some sort of speech, and know how to
    equip, use, and throw items. Construct humanoids (golems) are an
    exception. Humanoids make up the largest group of monsters; making
    humanoid slaying weapons particularly desirable. The monster class
    consists of several monsters including humans <tt>@</tt>, small
    humanoids <tt>h</tt>, grungy humanoids <tt>g</tt> (goblins,
    hobgoblins, gnolls, bugbears), imps <tt>I</tt>, orcs <tt>o</tt>,
    ogres <tt>O</tt>, pixies and quicklings <tt>p</tt>, minotaurs <tt>M</tt>,
    ratlings <tt>r</tt>, kobolds <tt>k</tt>, berserkers and barbarians
    <tt>K</tt>, townsfolk <tt>t</tt>, trolls <tt>T</tt>, giant
    humanoids <tt>H</tt>, extraplanar beings <tt>X</tt>, underdark
    beings <tt>u</tt>, chaos creatures <tt>C</tt>, werebeasts, and
    also most demons <tt>&amp;</tt>.
    <p> Regarding humanoids: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Arrows and quarrels of humanoid slaying exists, along with
        Kinslayer, Skullcrusher, Serpent's Bite, Executor and
        Vanquisher. </li>
      <li>Humanoids can be <tt>C</tt>hatted with, and are capable of
        using items in a number of ways. </li>
      <li>Humanoids can be pickpocketed. </li>
      <li>They are vulnerable to Mindcraft. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.9.4.7"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.4.7 Jellies <tt>j</tt></h4>
    Jellies can be troublesome in the early game due to several of their
    attacks - sickness, corrosion, poison, confusion, paralyzation. Gray
    oozes and ochre jellies will corrode weapons made of iron, mithril
    and adamantium or damage the PC with their acidic attacks when
    fighting unarmed. Gloves will be immediately destroyed. Mithril and
    adamantium weapons are more resistant to corrosion, but it will
    happen eventually - do not attempt to clear a jelly pit in melee
    with weapons made of iron (especially), mithril or adamantium. This
    can be problematic for a low level PC. Spells or missiles are
    preferable, but if a low level PC must melee these critters, stone
    weapons are a good choice since they do not corrode. Alternatively,
    the PC can wield a si and bash the jelly with it. As an artifact,
    the si cannot be damaged. PCs that are acid resistant will take no
    damage unarmed.
    <p> Gelatinous cubes can be particularly annoying because of their
      ability to destroy items that are lying on the ground. Losing that
      waterproof blanket in the SMC to one of these ugly blobs is
      extremely frustrating. Easily killed with missiles, spells and
      mindcraft.</p>
    <p> One of the nastier jellies is the stone ooze. The paralysis
      attack of these can be very, very nasty for PCs who have no means
      of paralyzation resistance (such as an amulet of free action).
      Attack them from a distance or run away.</p>
    <p> Here is the list of all jellies and their specialties: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>death ooze, yellow ooze - poisons, regeneration </li>
      <li>gelatinous cube - paralyzes, dissolves items on ground </li>
      <li>gibbering mouther - confuses </li>
      <li>gray ooze, ochre jelly - breeder, corrodes weapons (or hands,
        gloves, boots) </li>
      <li>green blob, green slime - breeder, sickens </li>
      <li>stone ooze - paralyzes, bypasses PV </li>
      <li>writhing mass of primal chaos - corrupts, slows; very
        dangerous for low level PCs </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Apart from arrows and quarrels of jelly slaying, only Soaker and
      Vanquisher slay jellies.</p>

    <h4>0.9.4.8 Plants <tt>P</tt></h4>
    Apart from animated trees in the Animated Forest, and the shambling
    mound, also green blob and green slime are considered plants. PC
    cannot use <tt>:s</tt> command to swap places with them (even Monks
    and Beastfighters using their class powers). When killed, animated
    trees often drop logs, usable in Bridge Building and Fletchery.
    Regular trees <tt>T</tt> are probably plants as well, however they
    can't be attacked. Though you may extract logs from them by <tt>U</tt>sing
    a hatchet on them. Be wary that chopping trees is very long process,
    which is shortened by the Woodcraft skill. It is rumored that <tt>h</tt>andling
    trees may yield treasure if one is persistent enough.
    <p> There are no arrows or quarrels of plant slaying. The two
      artifact weapons which slay plants are Scorched Spear and Black
      Thumb.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.9.4.9"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.4.9 Undead <tt>Z</tt></h4>
    Undead are a class of monsters consisting of reanimated corpses and
    spirits. They can be created by PC Necromancers using Necromancy,
    summoned by NPC Necromancers, or found randomly. The Dwarven
    Graveyard and the more generic, CoC Graveyard both feature massive
    numbers of undead. You can find even yet more undead by digging up
    the graves in a graveyard.

    <p> Regarding undead: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>All undead can attack in the dark. </li>
      <li>Liches, mummies, the Banshee and Griff Bloodax can see
        invisible. </li>
      <li>Amulet of protection from undead protects against their
        special attacks 60% / 80% / 120% of the time B/U/C. </li>
      <li>Necromancers level 6 and Paladins level 40 get some
        resistances against undead attacks, especially attribute drain
        and paralyzation. </li>
      <li>Paladins and Priests have the ability to turn undead, when
        they are in good standing with their deity. When turned, any
        affected undead will become scared and attempt to flee. Holding
        a holy symbol and <tt>U</tt>sing it will accomplish the same
        thing, but this costs a small amount of piety. Level 40 Priests
        can instantly destroy undead, through a class power. </li>
      <li>Weapons with the suffix of the sun will do double damage to
        the undead. Blessed items will similarly inflict +50% damage on
        undead (and demons). Finally, slaying weapons and ammunition
        that slay undead will get an automatic critical hit. A mace of
        disruption is a non-artifact undead slayer. </li>
      <li>Destroy Undead spell, as one might imagine, inflicts decent
        damage on undead. Healing spells damage the undead instead of
        healing them, thus allowing Healers (and others lacking more
        offensive spells) an additional opportunity. Likewise, Bless
        spell causes damage to undead instead of standard effect. Thrown
        (or wielded) potions of holy water also work. </li>
      <li>Mindcrafters are warned to never use their mind-damaging
        powers against the undead, as the experience causes a backlash,
        harming the Mindcrafter. At level 50, they receive only half of
        this damage. Note that telekinetic powers (Telekinetic Blast and
        Greater Telekinetic Blast) are safe to use against undead as
        they do not cause backlash damage. Undead are also not visible
        for Eyes of the Mind. </li>

    <h4>0.9.5 Strategies for dealing with particularly annoying monsters</h4>
    Suggestions for more annoying monsters are welcome. No uniques,
    though - they are dealt with in the section pertaining to their
    location.
    <p> This section is about <i>annoying</i> monsters. Not necessarily
      very dangerous or life-threatening, just monsters that are your
      personal pet peeve with some attack or characteristic that
      infuriates you.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.9.5.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.5.1 Early game</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>claw bugs <tt>i</tt></b> - Since claw bugs always ignore
        PV (luckily, they never damage armor) and there are almost no
        wearable items substantially increasing DV at this point in the
        game, fighting them in true berserker mode - wearing nothing and
        switching tactics to berserker (see section <a href="#0.7.4"
         >0.7.4</a>) might be worthwhile. In this mode, there are
        good bonuses to to-hit and to-damage values - usually enough to
        take them out in one hit. Of course, this is not necessary once
        the PC has some missiles and/or spells to take them out. Note
        that claw bugs are immune to mindcraft as are all insects. They
        are very fragile and pose a threat only due to their numerous (8
        per turn!) armor-punching attacks.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>ghuls <tt>z</tt></b> - They are only dangerous because of
        their paralyzation ability. Otherwise easy to kill. PCs with
        halfway decent DV should not have a problem.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>jellies <tt>j</tt></b> - Refer to section 0.9.4.7 above.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>karmic lizards <tt>l</tt></b> - See the section 0.9.3
        above.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>pixies <tt>p</tt></b> - These have an annoying habbit to
        steal most of the gold your PC is carrying, then teleport away.
        Wear money belt to prevent stealing. They are not dangerous
        otherwise.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.9.5.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.5.2 Midgame</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>worms <tt>w</tt></b> - Worms are a group of breeding
        monsters of various colors that may pose significant annoyance
        and even danger to the PC. Their main threat is that they
        multiply very quickly and, if killed in large numbers, tend to
        become significantly stronger - see <a href="#0.9.7">0.9.7</a>.
        <p> The following is a quick overview of the worms in the game
          and the abilities they possess: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>red worms: can breathe low-damage fire which may destroy
            items, immune to fire </li>
          <li>white worms: nothing remarkable </li>
          <li>green worms: may cause sickness </li>
          <li>brown worms: may cause paralysis </li>
          <li>purple worms: may cause poison </li>
        </ul>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>eyes <tt>e</tt></b> - One should slow down when an eye is
        encountered. These floating little beings can prove quite
        troublesome, especially for PCs with low Willpower and without
        confusion resistance. They generally have only 90 speed and thus
        can be outrunned. Also they have relatively low HP and don't
        cause too much damage - the main threat is their special attack
        which may leave the PC vulnerable for an attack of more powerful
        monsters, so a good strategy is dealing with them when they are
        alone. All eyes ignore water.
        <p> The following is a quick overview of the eyes in the game
          and the abilities they possess: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>staring eyes: may cause confusion </li>
          <li>chaos eyes: may cause corruption </li>
          <li>floating eyes: may cause paralysis </li>
          <li>magebane and magedoom eyes: may cause confusion, drain PP
          </li>
          <li>eyes of destruction: may destroy worn items and cause
            confusion, shrug off bolts often </li>
        </ul>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>dark elven priestesses/princesses <tt>u</tt></b> - These
        monsters, nicknamed "spider factories," have the following nasty
        traits: they summon spiders (poisoning monsters with high DV and
        PV that quickly gets even higher) quickly and in large numbers,
        they occasionally shoot energy bolts and they are highly magic
        resistant. Priestesses also have a corrupting hit and can
        paralyze in melee. Spiders (like all animals) can't open doors.
        If you can put closed doors between you and all the exits the
        spiders can use, you'll be protected until something else wades
        through them and opens them. You may also need to seek ways to
        slow the spiders (Slow Monster, stunning, paralyzation,
        confusion, Ventriloquism, etc.) so you can actually close the
        door. Spider corpses poison you shortly, but grant permanent
        poison resistance. Eat one as soon as you find one and can get a
        breather. Obviously bolt spells/wands are good against the
        spiders, though early characters often have too few PP/charges
        to use them easily for the task. Try to zap the summoner along
        with the summoned. In the rare cases where they don't resist,
        they tend to die quickly - they have low HP.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>dopplegangers <tt>@</tt></b> - These are frustrating
        because they deflect missiles and cause confusion. Doppleganger
        lords are somewhat more dangerous. Doppleganger kings are
        exceptionally dangerous even for very experienced PCs: they
        reflect the nature of the PC exactly in terms of DV and PV and
        may inflict substantially more damage than the PC is capable of
        dealing. Their speed is also nearly identical to the PC's
        although movement cost and hitpoints are not copied. Normal
        dopplegangers are easily killed with spells or mindcraft. All
        dopplegangers share an inherent weakness: they are helpless in
        the dark. If the PC can create darkness, from the spell, the
        scroll or the crystal, dopplegangers are easily killed in melee.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Dorn Beasts <tt>F</tt></b> - Annoying because of their
        constant paralysis attack. An amulet of free action will solve
        this problem. Less well known is the tactic of attacking them in
        darkness or while blind. A recent report suggests attacking them
        with missiles. Their paralysis attack does not seem to engage
        when using missile weapons.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>invisible stalkers <tt>@</tt></b> - They are what their
        name implies: invisible. You won't know what is attacking, only
        after it is killed you will find an invisible stalker in the
        kill list. Unless the PC has the See Invisible intrinsic of
        course. The message "You feel something passing very closely
        besides your head!" or "Something hits you!" means an invisible
        monster just attacked and possibly hit the PC. If the PC moves
        into an invisible monster, you get either "You swing at the
        air!" or "You hit something!" message. Besides invisible
        stalkers, only ogre magi and some uniques will cast Invisibility
        on themselves, but no other monster has intrinsic invisibility.
        Fighting these in a corridor would be a good tactic if the PC
        does not have access to the See Invisible intrinsic.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>mimics <tt>m</tt></b> - These annoying creatures can
        appear in a shop when the player is least expecting it (although
        they do not seem to show up in Terinyo or Lawenilothehl,
        thankfully, they <i>do</i> appear in the HMV shop - a warning
        for players that elect to descend through the UD to start the
        game). By the time the PC encounters them, they can generally be
        killed; they are simply surprising and startling. One is almost
        guaranteed in Waldenbrook's shop. Note that tension rooms full
        of mimics, master mimics and mimic hiveminds are much more
        dangerous than a single mimic in a shop. They have a paralyzing
        hit.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>ogre magi <tt>O</tt></b> - See the section on invisible
        stalkers above. On the top of being invisible most of the time,
        ogre magi also posses moderately powerful ice based ranged
        attack. Have See Invisible intrinsic, cold resistance, a ring of
        fire equipped, and the PC should have no problem dispatching
        ogre magi.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>ratling duelists <tt>r</tt></b> - Very annoying in melee
        thanks to their disarm ability. Have at least weapon mastery or
        use missiles/magic, if you want to avoid dropping your primary
        weapon. You will continue fighting unarmed if not paying
        attention. Alternatively, non-standard weapons (say, a statue)
        cannot be disarmed. Ratling duelists and especially later,
        ratling fencers and warlords, are not to be underestimated. They
        are fast, dodge attacks often, and have multiple attacks which
        ignore PV. Ratling duelists always drop gauntlets when killed.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>rust monsters <tt>R</tt></b> - These beasts will rust the
        PC's vulnerable armor and weapons. Extremely annoying, since all
        they have to do is touch the PC and a perfectly functioning
        sword of sharpness or phase dagger can be reduced to a useless
        hunk of metal. They can be pacified by throwing metal items at
        them. Quarrels are a good choice if the PC has some expendable
        ones. Their brethren, large rust monsters and giant rust
        monsters, unfortunately cannot be pacified in this way.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>vampires <tt>Z</tt></b> - Vampires can be annoying due
        their ability to drain Strength and Toughness. They hit quite
        often. Again, missiles or magic is preferable.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>vortices <tt>V</tt></b> - There are four types: fire, ice,
        acid and lightning. All will explode when near the PC and always
        do a significant damage, both to the PC's HP and equipment -
        regardless of DV and PV. On encounter, equip the PC with the
        appropriate resistance if possible. Fire and ice vortices are
        efficiently dispatched by cold based or fire based spells
        respectively. Killing them from distance or in one hit is
        recommended, though it may not be easy to achieve. Being at full
        HP is as well recommended strategy. Darkness could be very
        useful, since it seems vortices won't explode in darkness.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.9.5.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.5.3 Late game</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>annihilators <tt>C</tt></b> - Can destroy your precious
        eternium gear in no time.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>gorgons <tt>F</tt></b> - These are very dangerous because
        of their petrifying attack. By the way, petrification means
        death. Do not eat a gorgon's corpse unless the PC is wearing an
        amulet of petrification resistance! (or has petrification
        resistance intrinsic). High DV allows the PC to avoid gorgon's
        breath.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>emperor lichs <tt>L</tt></b> - Emperor lichs are trouble.
        An exception to the general rule in this section, these annoying
        monsters are quite capable of killing a PC quickly. They cast
        Death Ray, so resistance is essential. They see invisible, are
        attribute drainers and are summoners. A group of emperor lichs,
        such as those found in greater undead vaults, is a challenge
        even for level 50 PCs who have won the game. They are vulnerable
        to high effectivity fire spells. Improved Fireball with
        effectivity +20 or more and Willpower 48 or greater is a
        spellcaster PC's friend against emperor lichs.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>molochs <tt>&amp;</tt></b> - Molochs, and their larger
        brethren greater molochs, are a significant threat. Their melee
        attack can be for 100 HP or significantly more in the case of
        GMs. They fall into the annoying category because it is possible
        to run away from them with any PC that has halfway decent speed.
        They typically have a speed in the 60-70 range.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>quicklings <tt>p</tt></b> - In addition to punching
        through armor, all quicklings and are very, very fast. Regular
        quicklings and quickling queens will employ hit and run tactic.
        Quickling lords and kings use dark elven quarrels. They all try
        to avoid bolt spells by returning to a position where they
        cannot be hit, if possible. Quickling kings and queens see
        invisible. Quickling queens have very strong poison attack, so
        it may be necessary to deal with poison damage even if the PC
        has poison resistance. All quicklings regenerate health. Since
        they try to avoid melee and bolt magic, they are most easily
        killed with missiles, or in a corridor.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>titans <tt>H</tt></b> - Titans and greater titans are very
        powerful late game monsters. They have excellent health,
        defense, damage output and speed. They shoot eternium quarrels.
        They see invisible. A threat room full of titans could prove a
        significant challenge to even the most advanced PCs. Do not
        compare these to giants or ogres. Titans are <i>much</i>
        stronger.
        <p> </p>

    <h4>0.9.5.4 General strategies</h4>
    If you cannot win a fair fight and you also cannot retreat - either
    the way is blocked or the monster is faster, not everything is lost.
    There might be a way to disable your opponent somehow, helping you
    win the fight. The means to do so are detailed in the below table,
    listed approximately from weakest to strongest. Note potions have to
    be thrown at your opponent, not drunk.

    <h4>0.9.6 Weapon status - blessed, uncursed, cursed</h4>
    As previously noted, the damage inflicted on an opponent that falls
    into the demon or undead monster type is dependent on the weapon's
    blessed vs uncursed vs cursed status. The formulae are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>for blessed weapons, inflicted damage = (normal damage * 1.5)
        - PV </li>
      <li>for uncursed weapons, inflicted damage = (normal damage * 1.0)
        - PV </li>
      <li>for cursed weapons, inflicted damage = (normal damage * 0.5) -
        PV </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Cursed weapons also seem to be more prone to breakage. Blessed
      weapons seem to be less prone to breakage.</p>

    <h4>0.9.7 Monsters gain experience level - the uberjackal effect</h4>
    Monsters gain xp level when the PC is killing them. It means if you
    manage to kill a number of rats, the next generated rat will have
    higher xp level. Rarer creatures require fewer kills to raise their
    xp level, a minimum is 5. For example, orcs require 75 kills, rats
    and giant rats 50 kills, jackals 12 kills - avoid killing lots of
    those by any means! Exceptions are breeders, who never gain xp.
    Monsters gain:
    <ul>
      <li>PV +2 per 3 levels </li>
      <li>DV +1 per 5 levels </li>
      <li>number of attacks +1 per 10 levels </li>
      <li>damage +1 per 3 levels </li>
      <li>random HP increase proportional to level </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.9.8"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.8 Gaining experience</h4>
    High Learning increases experience gains. For every 1 xp gained
    (remainders are accounted for exactly, there is no rounding loss),
    the PC gains Le/1000 bonus xp. The Good Learner and Great Learner
    talents increase xp too. Good Learner alone is 150%, Good Learner +
    Great Learner is 120%. Remainders are accounted for incorrectly and
    there is rounding loss for many small kills.
    <p> The experience gained per killing a monster is dependent on
      Speed of both combatants according to the following formula:</p>
    <p> Exp_gained = base_exp * (monster_speed / PC_speed)</p>
    <p> This means lowering PC's speed as well as increasing monster
      speed before delivering the final hit are means of generating more
      experience. This is most commonly achieved by repeatedly casting
      Slow Monster spell at the PC. Beware however, there is a limit on
      maximum xp gain. Going beyond the limit will yield only 1 xp.</p>
    <p> Besides killing monsters, experience can be gained via disarming
      traps. A fraction experience (1/20) is gained when offering piece
      and when sacrificing monsters at an altar. There is no other known
      way of gaining experience.</p>

    <h4>0.9.8.1 Shambling mounds <tt>P</tt></h4>
    These guys love lightning. Any lightning damage increases their
    maximum HP by the damage amount. Note it still damages them, only
    their maximum HP gets increased. PCs with some lightning spell and
    some healing spell can make uber mounds rather quickly. They can
    then be dispatched via darkness or invisibility for large xp amount.

    <h4>0.9.9 Spellcasting monsters</h4>
    Not only the PC, but also some monsters are able to cast spells.
    However, the spell selection for monsters is very different, as is
    monster spell mechanics. Spellcasting monsters do not use the PP and
    spell knowledge/power system PC uses. There are three classes of
    monster spells: directed spells, touch attack spells, and
    non-directed spells, and two monster spellcaster's properties: spell
    range and spell power.
    <p> <a name="0.9.9.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.9.1 Spell ranges</h4>
    Directed spells have a range which is a property of the monster
    spellcaster. This range is the same for all directed spells, and is
    generally square; beware of diagonals. High level monsters gain 1
    spell range per 4 levels. Chaotic and lawful spellcasters have one
    third less range on Silvernight and Darknight, respectively. Base
    ranges are a function of spellcaster type as follows:

    <h4>0.9.9.2 Spell powers</h4>
    The damage of spells is determined by another parameter of the
    monster, the spell power. Every additional level gives a monster +1
    spell power; chaotic and lawful spellcasters get one third more
    spell power on Darknight or Silvernight respectively.

    <h4>0.9.9.3.1 Energy bolt / Death ray</h4>
    The Death Ray spell, described as an "energy bolt", attempts to
    instantly kill the target. It is a dodgable spell and has finite
    range. Even if it hits, the target still may make a saving throw and
    may have resistance; in either case, damage is done instead. There
    is no multiple death ray resistance. The damage done by a resisted
    death ray is equal to Xd3+Y where X = Max(15, spell power) and Y is
    1d(spell power)-1. The PC will save on a (Mana + Luck) in spell
    power chance.

    <h4>0.9.9.3.2 Stream of energy</h4>
    This is a simple non-elemental damage spell. It is displayed as a
    yellow line segment and described as a "painful stream of energy",
    or "strong magical energies" when affecting monsters. It has finite
    range and can be dodged when affecting the PC; against monsters, it
    can be shrugged like a bolt spell, with attack power equal to spell
    power. It does (spell power+2)d4 damage.

    <h4>0.9.9.3.3 Confusion</h4>
    This spell attempts to confuse its target. There is no path
    requirement; if the caster can see the PC and the PC is in range, it
    is fair game regardless of angle or anything in the middle. For
    monsters, success is based on a spell range and level, duration is
    Max(1, spell power/4)d2; for PC the maths are much more involved and
    not worth detailing here in prose. Chance to resist Confusion
    depends mainly on Willpower, with an effective +6 Willpower bonus
    per properly equipped -Conf item. Luck is also added to effective
    Willpower. Confusion duration depends mostly on -Conf items, but
    there is a small Willpower influence; Wi from 10 to 40 reduces
    average duration by 20% (no effect on maximum).

    <h4>0.9.9.3.4 Glowing Balls / Magic Missile</h4>
    This is attack spell which targets like an arrow. It is dodgable,
    and can be shrugged by exactly as a bolt spell. It displays as a
    blue <tt>*</tt> and is described as glowing balls, but in the
    endgame dump is named as magic missiles, leading many to believe it
    non-elemental, but it actually does fire damage; it speeds up
    Drakelings, can melt beeswax, and is reduced significantly by fire
    resistance (divided by 1 + 6 if intrinsic, + 3 per item). Base
    damage is (spell power/2)d6.

    <h4>0.9.9.3.5 Cone of cold</h4>
    Works like glowing balls, but deals cold damage. Users: ogre magus,
    Master Necromancer, emperor lich, shadow wyrm, Chaos Archmage, ElDeR
    cHaOs GoD, ancient sage.
    <p> <a name="0.9.9.3.6"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.9.3.6 Shock bolt</h4>
    Works like glowing balls, but deals lightning damage. Users: kobold
    shaman, dark sage, Chaos Archmage, ElDeR cHaOs GoD, ancient sage.
    <p> <a name="0.9.9.3.7"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.9.3.7 Avoiding directed spells</h4>
    Your ability to avoid spells is not affected by DV, tactics, what
    you're avoiding, or even the level of the caster. There are five
    checks to evade spells; only one of them needs to pass. Most of the
    checks are much harder in the dark. First, you will avoid a spell on
    a (Dx + Luck) in (Dx + 50 (120 in dark)) chance. Second, you will
    avoid a spell on a (Mana + Luck) in 1000 check. The third check only
    applies if your speed is greater than 100; you have a (speed - 100)
    in 100 (200 in darkness) chance to avoid spells, capped one short of
    perfection (99% or 99.5%). Thus, if speed is boosted above 200, or
    300 for darkfighting, effective immunity to bolts is achieved; this
    is useful to remember against dangerous spellcasters. Finally come
    the skill checks. Fourth is a straight Dodge in 1000 (2000 if
    darkness) check. Finally, an Alertness check with a difficulty of
    200 (400) is made. Since Alertness is a [+] skill, multiple checks
    are possible at high skill values; at 100, Alertness negates 7/8 of
    bolts that get this far. With 99 Dexterity, 200 speed, and 100
    Alertness, 1 in 2400 spells will connect.
    <p> <a name="0.9.9.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.9.4 Touch attack spells</h4>
    These spells can only be used in melee range, so avoiding them is
    easy - just stay out of range.
    <p> <a name="0.9.9.4.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.9.4.1 Drain attribute</h4>
    Monsters will only use Drain attribute against the PC, never other
    monsters. If successful, one random attribute is lowered by 1d3
    permanently.
    <p> The Drain attribute spell is used by the following spellcasters:
      black druid, great white wyrm, greater daemon, lich king, emperor
      lich, old crone, minotaur mage, multi-headed chaos dragon, Chaos
      Archmage, ElDeR cHaOs GoD, ancient sage.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.9.9.4.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.9.4.2 Curse</h4>
    This spell will only be used by monsters against the PC, and has two
    possible results. An item is selected from inventory completely at
    random. If the PC has no items, or gold is the item chosen, the PC
    himself will be subjected to the curse; otherwise, the chosen item
    will. If the PC already has the Cursed intrinsic, there is 16.7%
    chance to gain the Doomed intrinsic instead.
    <p> The Curse spell is used by the following spellcasters: black
      druid, quickling bard, great black wyrm, black wizard, green hag,
      annis hag, master lich, lich king, emperor lich, old crone,
      minotaur mage, multi-headed chaos dragon, Chaos Archmage, ElDeR
      cHaOs GoD, ancient sage.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.9.9.4.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.9.4.3 Teleport other</h4>
    Pretty self-explanatory effects, equivalent to zapping a wand of
    teleportation. Against monsters, only a level-dependent save is
    used; low-level monsters will almost never resist. In principle this
    provides a way to teleport Khelavaster off the stairs; sadly, the
    monster AI will never make attacks against dying sages. No effect on
    non-teleport levels.
    <p> The Teleport other spell is used by the following spellcasters:
      druid, quickling bard, fairy dragon, old crone, Chaos Archmage,
      ElDeR cHaOs GoD, ancient sage.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.9.9.4.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.9.4.4 Avoiding touch attack spells</h4>
    The PC avoids attribute drain or "Curse the PC" spells if Luck +
    1dMa-1 &gt;= 1d(spell power-1). Therefore, high Mana and Luck are
    extremely beneficial, but cannot provide enough safety from these.
    <p> Curse item and Teleport other use easier save. They are avoided
      if 1d(spell power)-1 &gt; Mana+Luck. Thus, high Mana can make your
      PC safe from item curses; the Mana needed in this way must be
      equal to the relevant spell power. With 25 or higher Mana, any
      item is safe from all cursing monsters that are not also attribute
      drainers (if the PC has positive Luck, and it is not Darknight).</p>

    <h4>0.9.9.5 Non-targeted spells</h4>
    These spells do not require an enemy at all.
    <p> <a name="0.9.9.5.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.9.5.1 Invisibility</h4>
    Turns the user invisible for (spell power / 2)d4 turns. Used by ogre
    magus (4d4 turns), Cat Lord (6d4 turns), and Chaos Archmage, ElDeR
    cHaOs GoD, ancient sage (31d4 turns).
    <p> <a name="0.9.9.5.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.9.5.2 Darkness</h4>
    Darkens an octagonal area around the caster. Diameter is equal to
    spell range. Used by black druid (diameter 5), and Chaos Archmage,
    ElDeR cHaOs GoD, ancient sage (diameter 15).
    <p> <a name="0.9.9.5.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.9.5.3 Heal</h4>
    Heals the caster up to (spell power)d5 damage, with no effect on any
    statuses. Used by priest (4d5), black druid (6d5), druid (13d5),
    ancient karmic wyrm (22d5), Ancient Chaos Wyrm (30d5), ancient blue
    wyrm (30d5), ki-rin (30d5), old crone (40d5), ancient sage (63d5).
    <p> <a name="0.9.9.5.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.9.5.4 Greater Heal</h4>
    This spell restores its user to full health and ends bleeding. Used
    by ancient sage, emperor lich, lich, lich king, master lich.
    <p> <a name="0.9.10"></a></p>
    <h4>0.9.10 Summoners and Breeders</h4>
    <b>Summoners</b> are a type of monster. In addition to their normal
    attacks and skills, they have the ability to magically call upon
    assistance. Different summoners can summon different types and
    numbers of monsters. Some summoners are capable of summoning more
    summoners and quickly get out of hand. Summoners will get exhausted
    by summoning and stop for a while but they will recover and resume
    summoning. If you or your companion fights them, they will find less
    time to continue summoning, but the only way to stop summoners for
    good is killing them.
    <p> List of summoners and what they summon: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Balor - Random monsters </li>
      <li>Black wizard - Random monsters </li>
      <li>Blink dog - Blink dog </li>
      <li>Chaos wizard - Chaos servant, Writhing mass of primal chaos,
        Greater chaos servant, Chaos warrior </li>
      <li>Dark elven priestess - Large spider, Giant spider, Cave
        fisher, Tarantula </li>
      <li>Dark elven princess - Large spider, Giant spider, Cave fisher,
        Tarantula </li>
      <li>Dark elven wizard - Large spider, Giant spider, Cave fisher,
        Tarantula </li>
      <li>Emperor lich - Random monsters </li>
      <li>Fistanarius the Greater Balor - Random monsters </li>
      <li>Jackalwere - Jackal </li>
      <li>Lich king - Random Monsters </li>
      <li>Master lich - Random Undead </li>
      <li>Mimic hivemind - Mimic, Greater mimic, Master mimic </li>
      <li>Necromancer - Zombie, Ghul, Skeleton </li>
      <li>Nonnak the Master Necromancer - Random undead </li>
      <li>Nuurag-Vaarn the Chaos Archmage - Random monsters </li>
      <li>Shadow wyrm - Shadow </li>
      <li>Shopkeeper - Thug (this summon happens once; Waldenbrook
        summons Muscular dwarves instead) </li>
      <li>Skeletal king - Skeletal warrior </li>
      <li>Wererat - Rat, Giant rat </li>
      <li>Werewolf - Wolf, Dire wolf, Silver wolf </li>
      <li>Werewolf lord - Wolf, Dire wolf, Silver wolf, Werewolf </li>
      <li>Werewolf king - Wolf, Dire wolf, Silver wolf, Werewolf,
        Werewolf lord </li>
      <li>Yulgash the Master Summoner - Random monsters </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <b>Breeders</b> are monsters with the ability to replicate.
      Unlike summoners, they can only create one type of monster
      (themselves), and can only create them one at a time. While all
      breeders create further monsters of the same species, there are
      two ways that such monsters can breed: either by spawning separate
      monsters of the same species, or actually duplicating themselves.
      When a monster duplicates ("The foo duplicates and another foo
      appears!"), its own HP is halved and the new monster is created
      with the same amount of HP. When a monster spawns another ("The
      foo spawns another foo!"), the spawner doesn't lose any HP and the
      spawned monster is created with its HP at full.</p>
    <p> One major difference between breeders and summoners is that
      breeders can be sterilized - ie. kept from replicating - using a
      scroll of vermin control, or a prayer. Note that Gremlins - who
      replicate only when being splashed with water, for instance from a
      water trap - are not true summoners nor are they true breeders -
      true summoners and breeders require no outside influence to create
      more monsters. They are included here for sake of completeness. It
      should also be noted that duplicated gremlins are considered
      summoned - not bred - creatures by the game.</p>
    <p> List of breeders and how they breed: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Battle bunny - duplicates </li>
      <li>Brown worm - spawns </li>
      <li>Chaos rat - duplicates </li>
      <li>Chaos spawn - spawns </li>
      <li>Claw bug - spawns </li>
      <li>Gray ooze - duplicates </li>
      <li>Greater claw bug - spawns </li>
      <li>Green blob - duplicates </li>
      <li>Green slime - duplicates </li>
      <li>Green worm - spawns </li>
      <li>Gremlin - multiplying itself when it meets water </li>
      <li>Killer bug - spawns </li>
      <li>Mutated battle bunny - duplicates </li>
      <li>Ochre jelly - duplicates </li>
      <li>Purple worm - spawns </li>
      <li>Red worm - spawns </li>

    <h4>0.9.11 Rage</h4>
    A monster can be enraged by a number of actions in the game. The
    exact effects of rage are the same for each monster, however - due
    to careless fury, enraged monsters can execute twice as many attacks
    as normal, gain +6 to-hit and +6 damage, but lose 3 points of DV.
    <p> The following actions are known to make monsters enter a state
      of rage: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Monster stepping on a corpse of another monster of the same
        race (and same class, where applicable) - "foo steps on the foo
        corpse and becomes enraged!" </li>
      <li>PC eating a corpse within a monster's line of sight that
        belonged to a monster of that monster's race - "The foo is
        enraged as he/she/it watches you!" </li>
      <li>Sometimes when a monster has taken a certain amount of damage,
        instead of panicking they decide to fight to the death - "The
        foo decides to fight to the death in a blind rage!" </li>
      <li>Dragons can be angered by <tt>g</tt>iving them a dragon hide
        item that is the same color as them - "The foo rips the
        &lt;item&gt; in a fit of anger apart! The foo roars in anger!" </li>
      <li>If the PC kills Ruun, all the inhabitants of Dwarftown will
        become enraged. This makes formidable NPCs such as Waldenbrook
        especially dangerous. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>0.10 Corruptions</h3>
    There is only short, rather cryptic introduction to corruptions in
    the <a href="adomman-L.html">ADOM
      Manual</a>. Press <tt>\</tt> to view your corruption status.
    <p> <a name="0.10.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.10.1 What is corruption?</h4>
    Corruption is unavoidable in the Drakalor Chain for any PC who wants
    to make progress in the game. It is a background process that
    happens as a result of the Chaos Gate at the bottom of the Caverns
    of Chaos being open. Some locations remain free of corruption
    despite the gate being open, notably those near the surface of the
    Drakalor Chain. In order to get anything done, however, the PC must
    descend into corrupting areas. It is only a matter of time after
    that until the first corruption occurs. After ninety days of game
    time elapses, corruption rate doubles. After the gate is closed,
    background corruption ceases, which is nice if the PC wants to play
    tourist for a while. However, corruption can still be caused by
    artifacts that corrupt (section <a href="#0.10.2.4">0.10.2.4</a>)
    as well as corrupting hits from monsters (section <a
      href="#0.10.2.3">0.10.2.3</a>).
    <p> Note that the possible corruptions occur in random order (not
      the order listed on this page) which is decided at the beginning
      of the game. However, if one or more corruptions are removed, the
      RNG is reseeded and the corruptions will reoccur in a new random
      order.</p>
    <p> The following is a complete list of corruptions along with some
      comments about their effects and workarounds: </p>
    <ol type="A">
      <li><b>You are surrounded by an unholy aura (Ch: -10, DV: +6).</b>
        <p> This causes monsters to become afraid of the PC at more or
          less random times. In their frightened state, they will flee.
          A very nasty side effect is that shopkeepers become
          homicidally enraged at PCs that move anywhere near shops with
          this corruption, fearing that their customers will be
          frightened away. Note that invisible PCs do not suffer the
          effects of this corruption: monsters that cannot see invisible
          do not detect this corruption. This works for shopkeepers
          until the "foo* stares at your position with great intensity"
          message is generated. After that, look out.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>You rage (DV: -9, +6 melee damage)!</b>
        <p> Mediocre increase to damage in exchange for losing nine
          points of DV. Not a very good bargain, especially for low
          level characters, since this will make them easier to hit (and
          some monster hits cause further corruption).</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Poison drips from your hands.</b>
        <p> Some players hate this corruption more than any other. PCs
          with this corruption poison any monsters they engage in melee
          (a nice effect), turn any potion they touch into poison (very
          bad) and curse any food they touch (very bad). It can result
          in starvation quickly. The workaround is to wear thick
          gauntlets, which negate all of the above effects. Better yet,
          gauntlets of eternal peace negate just the bad effects.
          Alchemistic gloves also can negate these effects when picking
          up potions or food items, but it is not guaranteed. However,
          alchemistic gloves <i>never</i> block the effects when
          drinking potions or eating food. Note that Poison Hands does
          not prevent the PC from <tt>U</tt>sing herbs, <tt>A</tt>pplying
          Alchemy or dipping into potions.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>You have grown thorns (3d3 melee damage, Dx: -2, Ap: -3).</b>
        <p> The extra melee damage occurs only when fighting unarmed.
          Also bleeding effect is added. Useful for Monks and
          Beastfighters, Necromancers using Shadow Touch. Useless waste
          of 2 Dx points for all others.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Your close attunement to corrupted astral space allows
          teleportation.</b>
        <p> Very, very nice if the PC has teleport control. Very, very
          annoying if the PC doesn't have teleport control.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>You have grown a bulging cranium (Le: +6, Wi: +4, Ap: -6,
          PV: -4, To: -3).</b>
        <p> Nice Learning and Willpower increases. PV goes down because
          the PC's inflated skull is thinner, making it easier to
          damage? Not good for looks or Toughness either.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>You are a living mana battery.</b>
        <p> Another nominee for the most hated corruption. All wands the
          PC touches are drained of their charges. This does not destroy
          them; their final charge can still be wrenched from them, but
          extremely annoying nonetheless. There is no workaround. Some
          side benefits: 1) every time the PC drains a wand, power
          points are added to the PC's power score: blessed wands give
          +2, uncursed +1 and cursed 0 2) Spell costs are reduced to 80%
          of their normal cost - note that this is not cumulative with
          Darknight / Silvernight reductions, since costs cannot drop
          below 50% 3) Mana regeneration is increased.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>You have grown horns (+3 melee damage, Ap: -4).</b>
        <p> Melee damage in exchange for Appearance.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Your antennae explore the details of your environment (Ap:
          -4).</b>
        <p> Kicks in quasirandomly (1/250 chance every turn) to reveal a
          bit of the dungeon layout in the PC's immediate vicinity. Loss
          of Appearance.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Your skin is covered by tough scales (PV: +8, Dx: -6, Ap:
          -4).</b>
        <p> Nice PV increase, nasty Dexterity decrease. More loss of
          Appearance.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>You have grown a total of 12 eyes (Ap: -6, Pe: +6).</b>
        <p> Nice Perception increase, still more loss of Appearance.
          Getting the idea? By the endgame, PCs tend to get <i>ugly</i>.
          ;-)</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>You exhale sulphur (Ch: -4).</b>
        <p> This enables the PC to spit a corrosive acid much the same
          as a Drakeling's racial ability.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>You look somewhat apish (St: +3, Le: -1, Wi: -1, Ch: -2,
          Ap: -3).</b>
        <p> This corruption's effects reoccur periodically. Maximum is
          set at beggining of game, 1d10+4. Its effects are cumulative
          over time, so the PC keeps gaining Strength while losing
          Learning, Willpower, etc. The game notifies you when this is
          happening with the phrase "You suddenly remember your
          ancestors." Nice for fighter types, nasty for spellcasters.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Your corrupted tissue seems to heal much faster.</b>
        <p> Another corruption causing cumulative effects. The PC heals
          faster, but the process leaves scars which reduce both
          Dexterity and Appearance by one point for each scar. Nasty
          over time.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Your feet have been transformed into hooves (+8 kicking
          damage, Dx: -6).</b>
        <p> Nasty loss of Dexterity, especially since most PCs aren't
          kickers anyway.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>You have become extremely thin and nimble (1/2 weight, DV:
          +6).</b>
        <p> Nice corruption. Six points of DV, but increases hunger by 1
          per turn. This is one of the corruptions needed to enter the
          Quickling Tree.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Your muscles have stiffened slowing you down (base action
          cost: 1500 energy points; PV: +4, St: +2).</b>
        <p> Another hated corruption. Slows down all your movement by
          1.5X.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>You have become very light (1/10 weight, St: -6, Dx: +4,
          To: -6, Ap: -6, +20 speed).</b>
        <p> Bad Strength and Toughness losses in exchange for speed and
          Dexterity. And yes, more Appearance loss. This is the other
          corruption needed to enter the Quickling Tree.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p> Becoming corrupted beyond this point turns the PC into a chaos
      creature and the game ends at that point. All those purple <tt>j</tt>s
      are probably former adventurers.</p>
    <p> <small>There are several more corruptions in v1.2.0, however
        the limit remains then same.</small> <a name="0.10.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.10.2 Gaining corruptions</h4>
    The game keeps track of corruption with a numerical value which
    increments each time twenty turns pass in a corrupting zone. Note
    that there are 18 corruptions listed above. For each 1000 "points"
    of corruption, the PC gains one corruption. Simple arithmetic shows
    that 180 points equals 1% corruption and the PC gains a new
    corruption each time he passes a multiple of 1000/180 = 5.556%. This
    is a strict rule only up to 99% corruption. The 99% corruption level
    begins at 99 * 180 = 17820 corruption points, but the PC is given
    extra leeway at this point and does not transform into a chaos
    creature until the counter is over 19000 points.
    <p> <a name="0.10.2.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.10.2.1 Background corruption</h4>
    As mentioned above, the PC must eventually enter areas where
    background corruption occurs. Areas with no corruption flag set:
    <ul>
      <li>Small Cave before day 90 </li>
      <li>Uninteresting Dungeon </li>
      <li>Dusty Dungeon lvls 1-2 </li>
      <li>Village Dungeon </li>
      <li>Druid Dungeon </li>
      <li>Puppy Cave </li>
      <li>Caverns of Chaos lvls 1-9 </li>
      <li>Infinite Dungeon lvls 1-9 </li>
      <li>Wilderness </li>
      <li>Gremlin Cave </li>
      <li>Dwarven Graveyard </li>
      <li>Water Dragon Cave </li>
      <li>Greater White Unicorn Glade </li>
      <li>Terinyo </li>
      <li>Lawenilothehl </li>
      <li>High Mountain Village </li>
      <li>Old Barbarian's Glade </li>
      <li>Mad Minstrel's Clearing </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Otherwise, the corruption points (CP's) gained depend on a
      Danger Level (DL) in particular area. Refer to section <a
        href="#Appendix_L">Appendix L</a> for the list of areas and their DL's.</p>
    <p> Thanks to Vladimir Panteleev for the following information.</p>
    <p> No other corruption occurs if: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the current level has the NoCorruption flag set (see the list
        above) </li>
      <li>DL &lt; 10 </li>
      <li>the Chaos Gate is closed </li>
    </ul>
    <p> The background corruption is applied once every N turns. If the
      PC is doomed, that's TWICE every N turns:</p>
    <p> if (TurnNumber mod N=0) or (Doomed and (TurnNumber mod N=1))
      then</p>
    <p> (this is how mathematicians/programmers say once normally and
      twice with doomed intrinsic per N turns)</p>
    <p> N is calculated based on the DL the PC is on. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>ID: N=CorruptionSpeed[ Max(Min(90,CurrentIDLevel)-10,0)/20 ] </li>
      <li>ID 66: N=20 </li>
      <li>Levels with Danger Level&gt;40: N=CorruptionSpeed[
        (DangerLevel-5)/10 ] </li>
      <li>Other N=CorruptionSpeed[ (DangerLevel-10)/10 ] </li>
    </ul>
    <p> CorruptionSpeed is a 5-element array: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>CorruptionSpeed[0]=20 </li>
      <li>CorruptionSpeed[1]=15 </li>
      <li>CorruptionSpeed[2]=10 </li>
      <li>CorruptionSpeed[3]= 5 </li>
      <li>CorruptionSpeed[4]= 2 </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Put in words, N can be 2, 5, 10, 15 or 20. The smaller N, the
      faster the corruption. In the Infinite Dungeon, N is 20 for levels
      10-29, 15 for levels 30-49, 10 for levels 50-69, 5 for levels
      70-89, and 2 for levels 90 and above. The exception is level I: 66
      (the special level with MaLaKaI) where N is 20. For other areas, N
      is 20 for DL 10-19, 15 for DL 20-29, 10 for DL 30-39, 5 for DL
      40-44, and 2 for DL 45 and above.</p>
    <p> If the background corruption is to be applied on this turn: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 CP is always applied </li>
      <li>if the current level is in the CoC and DL &gt; 45, +2 CP </li>
      <li>Chaos Plane: +1d100 CP's </li>
      <li>Emperor Moloch's level: +1d33 CP's </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Now, there's a bug in the corrupting code. This is how it SHOULD
      have worked: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>+1 CP if it's beyond day 90 </li>
      <li>+2 CP if it's beyond day 180 (cumulative with previous) </li>
      <li>+3 CP if it's beyond day 270 (cumulative with previous) </li>
      <li>+4 CP if it's beyond day 360 (cumulative with previous) </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <small>Bug fixed in v1.2.0.</small></p>
    <p> However, only the first line is executed - the 90-day limit.</p>
    <p> Being L+ decreases corruption by -30%, L or LN -10 %, C-
      enhances corruption by +30%, lawful Unicorn-borns -10%, L50
      Farmers and lawful Paladins -30%, lvl50 Monks and Druids -10%.</p>
    <p> Note that since background corruption is applied only by 1-2
      points, the above do not affect its speed, but major corruptions,
      such as eating chaotic corpses etc. The "crowned as champion"
      status does not affect corruption speed. By the way, 1 corruption
      = 1000 CP's.</p>
    <p> Note that a corrupting level can be made less so, or even
      completely noncorrupting, by reading scrolls of peace. These
      reduce the danger level, and thus the corruption rate of the
      current level. Bless the scrolls before reading them. The number
      of scrolls required depends on the level. If Dwarftown is
      generated on D: 10 or D: 11, for instance, reading a blessed
      scroll of peace will probably stop corruption. On the other hand,
      if it is necessary to stop corruption on a particular level of the
      Blue Dragon Caves, approximately nine scrolls of peace are
      required.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.10.2.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.10.2.2 Corruption traps <tt>^</tt></h4>
    Corruption traps are as common as any other trap in the dungeons.
    They cause 10d10 CP's. They are purple when revealed.
    <p> <a name="0.10.2.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.10.2.3 Corrupting hits from monsters</h4>
    Some monsters corrupt by hitting the PC in melee. Common ones
    include chaos brothers, chaos sisters and the grues found in the
    elemental temples. <a href="#Appendix_J">Appendix J</a> contains a complete
    list.
    <p> <a name="0.10.2.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.10.2.4 Artifacts which corrupt</h4>
    <a name="0.10.2.4.1"></a>
    <h4>0.10.2.4.1 Moon Sickle <tt>(</tt></h4>
    Moon Sickle is a unique artifact unlike any other in the game. It
    does not contain the essence of Chaos and Corruption and so does not
    corrupt merely by carrying it. Likewise, wielding it does not cause
    corruption. However, successfully hitting a monster with Moon Sickle
    adds 2d3 CP's. Although it has no slaying powers, it is worth
    considering as a weapon against very difficult monsters for those
    PCs who have trained polearms, despite its corrupting nature. It has
    excellent base to-hit and damage at +6, 10d4+6 and polearms have
    decent to-hit and to-damage modifiers. Remember, however, that Moon
    Sickle is AUTOCURSING. Also, it will create potions of raw chaos
    from regular potions by dipping it in them. This also means that
    holy water cannot be used to remove the curse.
    <p> Moon Sickle will be found guarded by an unnamed stone golem in
      the Caverns of Chaos, between Dwarftown and the Wall of Flames.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.10.2.4.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.10.2.4.2 When carried</h4>
    The following artifacts contain the essence of Chaos and Corruption
    and will corrupt the PC merely by carrying them:
    <ul>
      <li>Black Tome of Alsophocus (random artifact) <tt>"</tt> </li>
      <li>Boots of Great Speed (found in the Quickling Tree) <tt>[</tt>
      </li>
      <li>Shield of Raw Steel (reward for Kherab's first quest) <tt>[</tt>
      </li>
      <li>Amulet of Raw Steel (reward for Kherab's second quest) <tt>'</tt>
      </li>
      <li>Spear of Raw Steel (reward for Kherab's third quest, if you
        can get it) <tt>(</tt> </li>
      <li>Sceptre of Chaos (part of Chaos trinity, found in SIL (I:66))
        <tt>(</tt> </li>
      <li>Medal of Chaos (part of Chaos trinity, summoned by the
        Gaab'Baay) <tt>'</tt> </li>
      <li>Crown of Chaos (part of Chaos trinity, found in the Stone
        Circle) <tt>[</tt> </li>
    </ul>
    <p> The Black Tome of Alsophocus teaches the PC random spell, or
      improves knowledge in a known spell if read successfully. It
      grants 20 CP's per turn spent reading (base PP cost of the spell +
      3), but min 200 and max 6666. The corrupting artifacts provide
      about 1/2 CP per turn when in backpack, and almost 1 CP per turn
      when equipped. The effects are cumulative. Of course more
      corruption is applied when successfully used (spear &amp;
      sceptre).</p>
    <p> <a name="0.10.2.4.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.10.2.4.3 When used</h4>
    All of the Chaos Orbs fall into this category, however, there is a
    great deal of difference in the amount of corruption caused by using
    the different Chaos Orbs. Stephen White has determined the precise
    amount of corruption caused:
    <p> </p>
    <table>
      <caption>Corruption caused by using the Chaos Orbs</caption> <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Chaos Orb </th>
          <th>CP's added per use</th>
          <th>Effect </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Water </td>

    <h4>0.10.2.5 Potions of raw chaos <tt>!</tt></h4>
    Logically enough, if the PC drinks a potion of raw chaos it will
    cause corruption (50d5/50d10/50d30 CP's B/U/C). They can also
    corrupt, however, if the PC tries to use them to polymorph an item
    by dipping it in the potion. There is a chance the potion will
    explode, which causes 100d100 CP's as well as 10d30 damage. Dipping
    in potions of raw chaos will not make wands of wishing or rings of
    djinni summoning. See section <a href="#0.14.4">0.14.4</a>.
    <p> <a name="0.10.2.6"></a></p>
    <h4>0.10.2.6 Tracts of chaos <tt>"</tt></h4>
    Tracts of chaos grant corruption, ~100 CP's per reading. See section
    <a href="#0.2.6">0.2.6</a>.
    <p> <a name="0.10.2.7"></a></p>
    <h4>0.10.2.7 From pools <tt>0</tt></h4>
    Drinking from pools may result in the message "You feel corrupted!"
    (1/52 chance). Self-explanatory, DLd30 CP's. Additionally, a pool
    inside Stone Circle causes massive corruption (10d100 CP's) per sip.
    <p> <a name="0.10.2.8"></a></p>
    <h4>0.10.2.8 From corpses <tt>%</tt></h4>
    Some corpses will corrupt the PC if eaten. Obvious ones include the
    corpses of the Chaos Orb guardians. Others include Keethrax, Keriax
    and chaos animals. The effects won't be compiled here. You can
    browse <a href="#Appendix_J">Appendix J</a> or section <a href="#0.3.3"
     >0.3.3</a> for corruptions resulting from eating monster
    corpses.
    <p> <a name="0.10.2.9"></a></p>
    <h4>0.10.2.9 Riurry <tt>U</tt> - the Greater Black Unicorn quest</h4>
    Riurry will reward the PC with 1 - 2 corruptions for killing the
    Greater White Unicorn Yrruir.
    <p> <a name="0.10.2.10"></a></p>
    <h4>0.10.2.10 Being crowned a champion of chaos</h4>
    Being crowned a champion of chaos will cause 2 - 3 immediate
    corruptions in addition to making further corruption faster.
    Additionaly, 75% of demons will be generated neutral to crowned
    chaotics.
    <p> <a name="0.10.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.10.3 Removing corruptions</h4>
    There will be a time when your PC wants to remove one or more
    corruptions. Some corruptions are very troublesome and worth getting
    rid of immediately. Later in the game, removing corruptions may be
    necessary simply to extend the life of the PC. Whatever the reason,
    a thorough knowledge of how to remove corruptions should be part of
    every experienced player's repertoire. There are several ways of
    doing this as outlined below. Corruption removal items are among the
    most precious in the game. They should always be blessed unless the
    PC is trying to specifically remove only one corruption that is
    impossible to deal with (poison hands can be impossible to deal with
    without thick gauntlets) while preserving others (for instance one
    needed to enter the Quickling Tree).
    <p> <a name="0.10.3.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.10.3.1 Potions of cure corruption <tt>!</tt></h4>
    Potions of cure corruption are exactly what the name implies - they
    remove corruption, approximately 0.75 corruptions for each blessed
    potion of cure corruption the PC drinks. A potion of cure corruption
    is also a quest object for Gaab'Baay.
    <p> Beware of cursed potions of cure corruption. They cause
      corruption rather than curing it.</p>

      corruption:</p>

    <h4>0.10.3.1.1 Obtaining potions of cure corruption from Guth'Alak</h4>
    Potions of cure corruption can be obtained from the druid Guth'Alak
    in Terinyo. He will reward a non-chaotic PC with a potion of cure
    corruption for delivering a greater chaos creature's or highly
    corrupted creature's corpse to him.
    <p> He will provide potion of corruption for the corpse of the
      following monsters: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Snake from Beyond <tt>s</tt> </li>
      <li>master summoner <tt>@</tt> (Yulgash) </li>
      <li>Ancient Stone Beast <tt>F</tt> </li>
      <li>Ancient Chaos Wyrm <tt>W</tt> </li>
      <li>greater black unicorn <tt>U</tt> (Riurry) </li>
      <li>chaos archmage <tt>@</tt> (Nuurag-Vaarn) </li>
      <li>black unicorn <tt>U</tt> (the only non-unique) </li>
      <li>black druid <tt>@</tt> (Keethrax) </li>
      <li>Emperor Moloch <tt>&amp;</tt> </li>
      <li>multi-headed chaos dragon <tt>W</tt> (Keriax) </li>
    </ul>
    <p> If the PC is chaotic, it is a good idea to sell a chaos
      creature's corpse to Munxip for safekeeping, then buy it back at a
      later time when the PC is non- chaotic. It can then be traded to
      Guth'Alak for a potion of cure corruption.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.10.3.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.10.3.2 Scrolls of chaos resistance <tt>?</tt></h4>
    Blessed scrolls of chaos resistance remove about 1.5 corruptions per
    reading. There are several places where scrolls of chaos resistance
    can be obtained: the only absolutely guaranteed location is the
    hidden room in the High Mountain Village. This will always contain
    one scroll of chaos resistance, although beware - it is always
    cursed. Khelavaster will give six scrolls of chaos resistance to a
    PC that manages to save him. The dwarven mystic in Dwarftown may
    give four blessed scrolls of chaos resistance to neutral PCs. The
    bug temple has three cursed scrolls of chaos resistance. Finally,
    the Mad Minstrel will reward a PC who brings him the Weird Tome with
    five cursed scrolls of chaos resistance.
    <p> Beware of cursed scrolls of chaos resistance. They cause
      corruption rather than curing it.</p>

    <p> Note that these numbers are to a first approximation double
      those of potions of cure corruption. Thus cursed SoCRs are twice
      as bad as cursed PoCCs, while blessed SoCRs are twice as good as
      blessed PoCCs. The implications should be obvious: never drink or
      read any cursed corruption removal item, and bless SoCRs in any
      but a dire emergency.</p>

    <h4>0.10.3.3 Tracts of order <tt>"</tt></h4>
    Reading a tract of order amounts to an appeal to the lawful god for
    corruption removal. This is not free and uses up piety. Do not try
    this with a PC who does not have a very good relationship with his
    lawful god. (not exactly true - see section <a href="#0.2.6">0.2.6</a>)
    The amount of corruption removed is around 100 CP's. Tracts of order
    are most useful to get rid of an annoying corruption as soon as it
    occurs, thus reseeding the RNG and hopefully avoiding it the next
    time a PC receives a corruption.
    <p> <a name="0.10.3.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.10.3.4 Yrruir <tt>U</tt> - the Greater White Unicorn quest</h4>
    Yrruir will remove all corruption <b>once</b> as a reward for the
    PC killing the Greater Black Unicorn - Riurry. It is wise to wait to
    use this cleansing until it is absolutely necessary. If the PC is
    doing a normal ending, this should ideally be the last thing the PC
    does before leaving the Drakalor Chain to ensure a corruption-free
    ending, which leads to better scores and a happier future history
    for the PC after the game is finished.

    <h3>0.11 Companions</h3>
    Did you know that you can order your companions around? Press <tt>Ctrl-o</tt>
    to do so. Press <tt>:c</tt> to view a list of your companions.
    <p> Companions are allies who will help the PC, to a point. They can
      be obtained in several ways: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bards and Farmers get an animal companion from the start </li>
      <li>scrolls of familiar summoning </li>
      <li>figurines of wondrous power </li>
      <li>wishing for <tt>friends</tt> </li>
      <li>taming monsters by giving away items or by using the Music
        skill </li>
      <li>in the HMV: Hawkslayer, Borys </li>
      <li>slaves are created by using the Necromancy skill on humanoid
        corpses </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Companions are often referred to as pets if they are animals.
      One word of caution before attempting to create a powerful
      companion - they are fickle and will sometimes turn on the PC at
      the slightest provocation - such as unintentionally triggering a
      fireball trap, injuring the companion. This is a very common cause
      of death from powerful companions. Note that fire-immune
      companions will not turn hostile. Some types of companions have a
      distinct personality and bear careful watching. A high Charisma
      score is very helpful when ordering companions about. Most
      companions (not undead like an emperor lich) can be healed using
      any of the normal techniques - casting Heal and throwing potions
      of healing, for example.</p>
    <p> One problem that many players have with companions is that
      companions have a fixed speed. This means that as the game
      progresses and the PC gains speed via wearables, the Athletics
      skill, eating quickling corpses, etc., companions become slower
      and slower relative to the PC. This can become very annoying, with
      the PC forced to wait for companions to catch up. This problem
      makes many players reluctant to rely too heavily on companions.</p>
    <p> Note also that companions cannot accompany PCs to D:50.
      Companions can be <i>created</i> on D:50, but they cannot cross
      D:49.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.11.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.11.1 Scrolls of familiar summoning <tt>?</tt></h4>
    These scrolls can be read to create a tame monster. The monster
    created is dependent on the danger level of the dungeon level. This
    means it is to the PC's advantage to read these in the most
    dangerous place possible. In the early midgame, the best place is
    probably the Dwarven Halls, since almost anything can show up there.
    Ancient karmic dragon, emperor lich and balor companions have been
    generated in the Dwarven Halls, for instance. B/U/C status of the
    scroll (+6 DL/0/-6 DL) as well as the Raven birthsign (+5 DL) also
    contribute to the level of the companion.
    <p> <a name="0.11.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.11.2 Figurines of wondrous power <tt>]</tt></h4>
    These miniature statues are a relatively new feature in ADOM,
    implemented by TB in response to players' requests for pet shops.
    Figurines can also be found randomly in the dungeons. They generate
    a monster when <tt>u</tt>sed; the type of monster corresponds to
    the name (i.e. a jackal figurine of wondrous power). If the figurine
    is blessed when <tt>u</tt>sed, the monster produced is tame. As
    with scrolls of familiar summoning, it is best to use them in a
    dangerous place. The Small Cave is ideal, since newly generated
    monsters have roughly twice the experience level of the PC.
    <p> <a name="0.11.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.11.3 Taming monsters</h4>
    This is a specialty of Bards, but any PC with the Music skill can
    try to tame monsters by placing a musical instrument in the tool
    slot and <tt>u</tt>sing it. Most PCs are not very successful at
    this until the Music skill level is in the 90s. The success rate is
    also dependent on the type of instrument used, with heavier
    instruments generally better than light ones. No PC can tame a pet
    if there are already three pets on a dungeon level. One or more pets
    must be led to a different level and left there. The PC can then
    return to tame more.
    <p> Beggars can be made into companions by giving them gold and/or
      food. It requires about 8000 gold pieces and 10 cooked lizards.
      Berserkers of the same gender can be tamed by giving them a
      wedding ring.</p>
    <p> Some monsters can be tamed by feeding them. Cave lions and wild
      cats can be tamed by giving them rat or giant rat corpses. This is
      very useful to remember if the PC wants the Ring of the Master Cat
      (see section <a href="#3.16">3.16</a>). Cave tigers can
      also be tamed, but they refuse to eat rat or giant rat corpses.
      Instead, they like pieces of raw or fresh meat. Unfortunately, it
      takes more than five pieces of meat to completely tame them; this
      is out of reach for most PCs. Wild cats, cave lions, giant
      raccoons, and black hurthlings can also be tamed with fish, which
      can be obtained from water squares in the wilderness (see section
      <a "#0.4"="">0.4</a> Survival). Dogs can be tamed by giving them
      bones, which are readily available by killing skeletons. This can
      be especially useful with blink dogs. Tame a blink dog with bones,
      then get it involved in a fight. The blink dog will summon more of
      his brethren, some of which will inevitably be killed. A blink dog
      corpse will eventually be generated, which grants teleport control
      when eaten. This is particularly useful for lawful PCs. Since
      blink dogs are lawful, killing them will wreak havoc on a lawful
      PC's alignment.</p>

    <h4>0.11.6 Slaves</h4>
    Slaves are the undead created to serve a Necromancer PC. They share
    some characteristics with companions. They will fight against a
    Necromancer PC's opponents up to the point where injuries cause them
    to panic and become afraid of further combat. As with companions, a
    high Charisma score enables the Necromancer to better control his
    slaves. Note that traditional methods of healing damage undead
    rather than healing them. The Bless spell also damages undead.
    Undead in skeletal form (skeletons and skeletal warriors) can be
    healed by giving them bones. Others must simply heal at their
    natural rate, which is often frustratingly slow. Unlike companions,
    slaves will never turn on their master.
    <p> If a Necromancer manages to survive to a high enough level to
      find quickling corpses, especially higher-level quickling corpses,
      most of the problems with undead vanish. Quicklings are considered
      humanoid in ADOM and so their corpses can be animated with
      Necromancy. They are extremely fast (this also means the problem
      with slow companions vanishes) and regenerate wounds at a
      phenomenal rate. One particular quickling king skeletal warrior on
      record killed Nuurag-Vaarn, the Chaos Archmage, before the PC knew
      it had happened.</p>
    <p> Note that slaves are not subject to the experience level 50
      limit as PCs are. It is quite possible for slaves to reach
      experience level 100 and higher. Needless to say, they become
      formidable at those levels.</p>
    <p> One trick Necromancers can use to create out of depth slaves is
      to exploit the properties of the Small Cave (check section <a
        href="#1.4">1.4</a> for a general explanation of how the Small
      Cave works). In this scenario, a Necromancer PC avoids entering
      the Small Cave at the beginning of the game, instead gaining early
      experience in the Infinite Dungeon or elsewhere. As the game
      progresses, a source of invisibility will eventually be found. It
      is rare for monsters that see invisible to be generated in the
      Small Cave. At the same time, many are humanoid and their corpses
      are usable for Necromancy. If an experience level 20 Necromancer
      enters the Small Cave while invisible, he can reasonably expect to
      leave or descend into the Unremarkable Dungeon with a couple of
      level 35 - 40 slaves. Very useful at that point in the game.</p>
    <p> Creating undead corpses is chaotic act, which reduces alignment
      by 300, costs PP (increases with level) and most importantly Mana.
      When Mana is reduced to 1, the PC can continue creating slaves at
      no Mana cost, but only those costing 1 Mana. The PC "is not
      powerful enough" to create slaves which would reduce Mana
      attribute below zero. However, animating a corpse trains Mana 2
      000 points. Note that lvl 1-5 Necromancers, as well as other
      classed dabbling in Necromancy, don't get to choose, but create
      zombie or skeleton randomly. The chance is 100% zombie at level 1
      to about 50% zombie / 50% skeleton at level 5. Mana cost is
      reduced for Necromancers at level 40.</p>

    <h3>0.12 Powers</h3>
    Powers in ADOM are intrinsics, status conditions and item powers.
    Status conditions differ from intrinsics, as intrinsics are usually
    permanent unless/until they are removed (by removing an item if
    granted by one; or by magical means such as pools or karma). Also,
    status conditions appear in the bottom left of the game screen;
    whilst intrinsics can usually only be identified by a potion of
    insight or the Revelation spell. Item powers are magical properties
    of certain items, usually artifacts.
    <p> <a name="0.12.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.12.1 Intrinsics</h4>
    There is no command to view your intrinsics. You have to find a way
    to see them in game. The available methods are:
    <ul>
      <li>drink a potion of insight </li>
      <li>cast the Revelation spell </li>
      <li>intrinsics are revealed upon death </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.12.1.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.12.1.1 Resistances</h4>
    There are various resistances available. These are:
    <ul>
      <li>damage types: fire, cold, acid, shock </li>
      <li>special attacks: paralysis, petrification, poison, confusion,
        death rays, sleep, stun, sickness </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Remember that resistance does NOT equal immunity in ADOM, ie.
      being hit by a death ray while resistant will not kill you
      instantly, but will still deal a significant amount of damage.
      Some of the resistances can be gained by eating an appropriate
      monster corpse: Intrinsic fire resistance can be gained by eating
      the corpse of fire-related creatures. The game generates messages
      related to this: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>fire beetle (50% chance of gaining fire resistance): You
        suddenly feel very hot! (whether or not resistance has actually
        been granted) </li>
      <li>fire lizard (10% chance of gaining fire resistance): You
        suddenly shiver. (fire resistance granted) This stuff cools you
        down! (fire resistance not granted) </li>
      <li>larger fire creatures, fire drakes, red dragons, and red
        wyrms, grants fire resistance every time </li>
    </ul>
    <p> There are further considerations about fire resistance in the
      Tower of Eternal Flames. See section <a href="#2.5">2.5</a>
      for more explanation. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>cold resistance can be gained by eating white dragons or white
        wyrms corpses </li>
      <li>acid resistance can be gained by eating ankheg, ant, black
        dragon or black wyrm corpses </li>
      <li>shock resistance can be gained by eating lightning lizard,
        blue dragons or blue wyrms corpses </li>
      <li>poison resistance can be gained by eating giant centipede,
        cave fisher, tarantula, snake, viper, spider, or dark elven
        corpses. Be aware that most of this both poisons the PC and
        grants resistance, so the PC will have to endure a brief period
        of poisoning </li>
      <li>petrification resistance can be gained by eating gorgon corpse
        (but the PC should have it already by other means, else is
        risking death) </li>
    </ul>
    <p> An interesting test conducted by Petri Sihvola regarding
      petrification by a gorgon's breath: </p>
    <pre>&gt; I did some testing and there's an approximate 50% chance of dying
&gt; to a gorgon breath without resistance. However, if DV is high enough
&gt; the chance is drastically reduced. This one shows my DV and how many
&gt; times I died:

&gt; DV:23 10/20
&gt; DV:44 8/20
&gt; DV:53 1/20
&gt; DV:69 0/20
</pre>

    <h4>0.12.1.2 Immunities</h4>
    Immunity to the four basic damage types is possible: fire, cold,
    acid and shock. Immunity means that the PC will take no damage from
    the corresponding elemental attack. However, creatures which deal
    elemental damage can still harm the PC, due to their ability to deal
    physical damage. The PC is only immune to damage from the elemental
    attack.

    <h4>0.12.1.3 Dooming and Cursing</h4>
    Basically, Cursed and Doomed intrinsics decrease PC's Luck, which is
    a hidden property. See section <a href="#0.6.4">0.6.4</a>
    for details.
    <p> Dooming or Cursing, as might be expected from the names, is
      generally to be avoided. They result from robbing shops, by
      drinking from pools, attacking karmic creatures in melee, reading
      scrolls of ill fate, cursing monster attacks (green hag, annis
      hag, black wizard, black druid), or eating certain corpses: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cursing only: ancient dwarf, annis hag, green hag, quasit </li>
      <li>Dooming only: least/lesser/greater daemon, Cat Lord </li>
      <li>both: Cute Dog, dwarven child, Oracle, Priest, royal guardian,
        (greater) white unicorn </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Cursing makes the game nudge all the die-rolls against the PC,
      generate more monsters which hit harder while the PC's hits become
      weaker. Dooming is a more severe form of this. Dooming also
      increases background corruption rate, and makes it much more
      difficult to pray for divine help.</p>
    <p> Nevertheless, there are ways to exploit these intrinsics. These
      techniques are not for the beginner, of course. Vaults and
      wilderness encounters become more common. If the PC wants to
      achieve Grand Mastery in a weapon class, becoming Cursed and/or
      Doomed in the wilderness is the only way to do it in a reasonable
      time frame.</p>
    <p> Dooming and cursing can be removed by sacrificing at a coaligned
      altar. It may take considerable sacrificing to remove the
      Cursed/Doomed intrinsics, since they are only removed at the "very
      close" level of piety. Praying while the PC is already at very
      close status also may remove dooming and/or cursing, although
      these intrinsics make it more difficult to appeal for divine
      assistance, as noted above. Removing Dooming (only) results in the
      message "You feel a terrible gloom being lifted from you."
      Removing Cursing (only) results in the message "You feel
      relieved." Removing both Cursing and Dooming simultaneously
      results in only the "You feel a terrible gloom being lifted from
      you." message.</p>
    <p> Another trick for exploiting the Doomed state is as follows: If
      a PC finds an altar early in the game, ideally before the Si level
      so that zero or very few artifacts have been generated, the PC
      should purchase or acquire plenty of food (cooked lizards and/or
      stomafillia herbs), become Doomed by eating a dooming corpse
      (daemons and quasits spring to mind) or wearing a ring of doom,
      and then exploit the heavy monster generation by sacrificing the
      monsters on the altar. This can quickly lead to very close or even
      extremely close status. After the Dooming is removed, by removing
      a cursed ring of doom or through reaching very close status, the
      PC can be crowned or precrowned.</p>
    <p> Dooming also has an effect in dark rooms: if a Doomed PC wanders
      into a dark room, there is 2% chance for an instakill "You are
      likely to be eaten by a grue." (this only applies to Doomed
      characters). Deliberately playing in a Cursed or Doomed state is
      dangerous and should be reserved for those players who know
      exactly why they are doing it.</p>
    <p> There is a game bug that causes fireproof blankets to be
      positively affected by the Cursed and Doomed intrinsics. It makes
      them last almost forever in the ToEF. It is probably not worth the
      cursing or dooming to make the blanket last. The ToEF is usually
      difficult enough in a Blessed state. <small>The bug is fixed in
        v1.2.0.</small></p>
    <p> The following items grant Cursing/Dooming intrinsics: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cursing only: Black Torc, Executor </li>
      <li>Dooming only: armor/weapon/missile of damnation, javelin of
        doom, Celestrix </li>
      <li>both: ring of doom, Crown of Science, Crown of Chaos, Medal of
        Chaos, Sceptre of Chaos, Boots of Great Speed </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.12.1."></a></p>
    <h4>0.12.1.4 Lucky and Fate smiles</h4>
    Basically, Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics increases PC's Luck,
    which is a hidden property. See section <a href="#0.6.4">0.6.4</a>
    for details.
    <p> The Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics are the good counterparts
      to the Cursing and Dooming intrinsics, respectively. They cause
      the game to nudge die-rolls in the PC's favor. The effect is not
      as dramatic as the Dooming and Cursing intrinsics - Fate smiles
      almost counters Cursing. It should be noted that all four
      intrinsics may be present simultaneously. The negative ones are
      considerably stronger.</p>
    <p> The Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics are naturally gained by PCs
      as they sacrifice on coaligned altars; the messages are:</p>
    <p> "You feel an inner strength lifting your spirits!" - The Lucky
      intrinsic<br>
      "You feel very close to -deity-." - The Fate smiles intrinsic</p>
    <p> Eating karmic corpses increases Luck, by losing Dooming,
      Cursing, or gaining Lucky or Fate smiles intrinsics. Scrolls of
      luck work similarly but have no effect on Dooming.</p>
    <p> The following items grant Lucky/Fate smiles intrinsics: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lucky only: amulet/ring of luck, Preserver, Bracers of War,
        Purifier </li>
      <li>Fate smiles only: Ring of the Master Cat </li>
      <li>both: Ankh, True Strength </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>0.12.1.5 Teleportitis and Teleport Control</h4>
    Teleportitis is a "disease" that causes your PC to teleport around
    randomly. It is obtainable from pools (you feel jumpy), corruption
    (your close attunement to corrupted astral space allows
    teleportation), from eating the right corpse (pixie) and items (helm
    of teleportation, cloak of Oman). It can be useful for escaping
    tight spots such as being surrounded by monsters (though it never
    seems to kick in when needed ;), for shoplifting and for reaching
    areas that are usually inaccessible.
    <p> Teleport Control allows you to choose the destination when
      teleporting your PC. It works whether the cause of the
      teleportation is teleportitis or deliberate, such as <tt>z</tt>apping
      a wand of teleportation or casting the Teleport spell at the PC's
      current location. Mindcrafters always get teleport control at
      experience level one, others have to rely on eating the right
      corpse (blink dog), drinking from pools (you feel like jumping
      around) or wearing items (amulet/ring of teleport control, boots
      of the Divine Messenger).</p>
    <p> Controlled teleportation is important in the game. There is a
      guaranteed wand of teleportation in the VDDL level of the
      Assassin's Guild. It can be found using any of the item detection
      techniques. The wand and potions of booze are then on-demand
      teleportation. Teleport control is not guaranteed but if
      necessary, the PC can stair hop in the Infinite Dungeon between I3
      and I4 until blink dogs are generated.</p>
    <p> The following locations disallow teleportation of any source: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any elemental temple. This does not include the lower levels
        of the Tower of Eternal Flames. </li>
      <li>The last level of the Tomb of the High Kings - the actual tomb
        containing the piranha lake and RotHK. (<a href="#2.12">2.12</a>)
      </li>
      <li>BUGCAV - the underground level of the Bug Temple. (<a
          "#2.3"="">2.3</a>) </li>
      <li>The Cat Lord level. (<a href="#3.16">3.16</a>) </li>
      <li>The final level of the Assassins Guild. (<a href="#2.11.3">2.11.3</a>)
      </li>
      <li>D:49. (<a href="#3.23">3.23</a>) </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.12.1.6"></a></p>
    <h4>0.12.1.6 Invisibility and See Invisible</h4>
    Invisibility provides several bonuses to Stealth, Backstabbing, to
    hit/damage etc. Be aware however that invisible PCs are not allowed
    to fight in the Arena. Invisibility can be gained by drinking from
    pools (you suddenly are gone), eating invisible stalker corpse (10%
    chance), or wearing items, such as ring/robe/cloak of invisibility,
    or Brannalbin's Cloak of Defence. Being invisible by wearing items
    severely increases food consumption, see section <a href="#0.3.2"
     >0.3.2</a> for details. Potions of invisibility/visibility
    and the Invisibility spell provide temporary effect.
    <p> The See Invisible intrinsic can be gained by drinking from pools
      (your eyes tingle), eating invisible stalker corpse (90% chance),
      wearing a ring of see invisible, Amulet of Raw Steel, Medal of
      Chaos, Ring of the Master Cat, Crown of Leadership, Ancient Mummy
      Wrapping, Shirt of The Saints, or wielding Rune-covered Trident or
      Trident of The Red Rooster.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.12.1.7"></a></p>
    <h4>0.12.1.7 Water breathing</h4>
    It is possible to gain the water breathing intrinsic by eating
    Blup's or Shyssiryxius' corpse. The message "For some seconds a
    strange liquid seems to fill your lungs." is generated.
    <p> Elementalists receive water breathing as an intrinsic class
      power at experience level 25. Certain items and wielded weapons
      grant the intrinsic: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>helm/amulet of water breathing </li>
      <li>the rune-covered trident - when wielded </li>
      <li>the Trident of the Red Rooster - when wielded </li>
      <li>the Medal of Chaos - when worn </li>
    </ul>
    <p> The following items also stop drowning, although water breathing
      is not listed as an intrinsic at the time. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>rings of the fish - AUTOCURSING; 1 blessed or 2 of any status
        stop drowning damage, single uncursed ring stops drowning 80%,
        cursed 60% of the time - if the PC is not cursed or doomed </li>
      <li>armor of the sea - stops drowning 100%, 80%, 60% of the time
        (blessed, uncursed,cursed) </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.12.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.12.2 Status conditions</h4>
    Status conditions are effects caused by certain actions in the game
    that temporarily influence characteristics of the PC (or a monster,
    if cast on one by certain means). Such characteristics include loss
    of HP, loss of certain attributes, inability to use certain commands
    or even complete loss of mobility for a certain amount of turns.
    Some may even be fatal. Status conditions are almost always
    negative; though a few can actually have positive effects.

    <h4>0.12.3 Item powers</h4>
    For the effects of "Essence of Chaos and Corruption" power, see
    section <a href="#0.10.2.4">0.10.2.4</a>.
    <p> <a name="0.12.3.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.12.3.1 Regeneration</h4>
    Regeneration is a special item power which generates one additional
    hit point per turn. It works in addition to natural regeneration
    described in section <a href="#0.14.6">0.14.6</a>. The effects are
    cumulative, so if the PC has two sourcers of Regeneration, it gains
    additional 2 HP per turn. The following items grant Regeneration:
    crown/ring/bracers of regeneration, knife of endurance, Bracers of
    War, Preserver, True Strength, and Celestrix. It is possible to
    regenerate a maximum of 9 HP per turn via Regeneration (head,
    amulet, girdle, hands, rings, bracers, missile).
    <p> <a name="0.12.3.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.12.3.2 Critical hits</h4>
    Critical hits is a special item power which allows the PC to score
    critical hits more often. If a Critical hit is scored, the attack
    message generated includes "with full force" phrase. In case of
    missile attack, the message includes "exactly hit" phrase. As
    critical hits do not bypass PV, it is possible to receive the "You
    hit the -monster- with full force and fail to hurt it." message. In
    such a case even the double amount of damage wasn't enough to get
    past the PV. Consider switching the form of offense. The following
    items grant Critical hits: orcish dagger, whip of slaughtering,
    murderous weapon, Bracers of War, Ring of the Master Cat, Grod,
    Serpent's Bite, Axe of the Minotaur Emperor, and Spear of Raw Steel.
    Refer to section <a href="#0.7.7">0.7.7</a> for more
    quantitative details.
    <p> <a name="0.12.3.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.12.3.3 Autocursing</h4>
    Autocursing items become cursed when equipped. It is obviously a bad
    effect, though not terrible for moderately advanced PC, since the
    curse can be removed via regular means, which include dipping the
    item into potion of holy water, reading a scroll of uncursing,
    casting the Remove Curse spell, praying, or using Wizard's 40th
    level class power. The following mostly bad items share the
    AUTOCURSING property: amulet of hunger, ring of doom, ring of the
    fish, ring of weakness, gauntlets of peace, boots of the slow
    shuffle, auto-locking armor, Black Torc, Medal of Chaos, Crown of
    Science, Shezestriakis, Moon Sickle, and Kinslayer.
    <p> <a name="0.12.3.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.12.3.4 Slaying</h4>
    Many artifact and few special regular weapons are imbued with
    Slaying powers. This means the particular weapon always scores a
    critical hit against certain monster types. Vanquisher is very
    valued artifact weapon since it slays almost everything. A missile
    of slaying (without specification) slays everything. Refer to
    section <a href="#0.9.4">0.9.4</a> to determine monster
    types. <br>

    <h4>0.12.3.5 Returning</h4>
    Some missiles or weapons possess a special Returning power, which
    means the missile or weapon returns when thrown. This does not mean
    the PC catches it automatically - the actual chance of successfully
    catching a returning missile depends on Dexterity and Luck. The
    following missiles and artifacts share the Returning power:
    dagger/spear/drakish scurgar of returning, curved throwing club,
    javelin of doom, boomerang, Black Torc, Rolf's Companion,
    Rune-covered Trident, Trident of the Red Rooster, Hammer of the
    Gods, and Spear of Raw Steel.
    <p> <a name="0.12.3.6"></a></p>
    <h4>0.12.3.6 Penetration</h4>
    Penetration is the act of bypassing the PV of a creature in combat,
    dealing damage as if the creature has PV of 0. For PC, penetration
    can only be achieved via a phase dagger, a penetrating weapon, a
    missile of penetration, or via Archer's 40th level class power,
    which grants 20% chance of bypassing enemy armor when using missile.
    On the other hand, several monsters, such as ratling duelists and
    claw bugs, will always bypass the PV of the PC.
    <p> <a name="0.12.3.7"></a></p>
    <h4>0.12.3.7 Item statuses</h4>
    The following statuses modify the item's function or stats in some
    way. More than one status can be present at the same time.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Rusty</b> - iron items become rusty by exposure to water -
        swimming, water traps, rain, water breath attacks. Water traps
        and rain can be prevented by wearing a hooded cloak. Other
        common cause to rusting is (large/giant) rust monster. Dipping
        iron items into a potion of water or cursed oil of rust removal
        also results in rusty status. Rusty weapons deal half damage and
        are more prone to breaking. Rusty armor reduces Appearance by 1
        and is more prone to destruction. Rusty tools are more liable to
        breaking when used. Rusty wands usually function normally. Rust
        is removed by dipping the item into a non-cursed oil of rust
        removal, or via Smithing/Glod. </li>
      <li><b>Broken</b> - weapons, keys and wands may become broken
        simply by frequent usage. Blessed items are less prone to
        breaking, cursed more. Cursed scrolls of repair break items,
        even the non-breakable ones (such as herbs; broken potions still
        can be quaffed with usual effect, broken scrolls and books can
        be read etc.). Broken weapons deal only half damage (cumulative
        with rust). Broken wands and keys are non-functional. Broken
        status of metal items (except gold, since there are no gold
        ingots) can be removed by Smithing. Non-cursed scroll of repair
        or Glod will remove broken status from any item or items stack.
      </li>
      <li><b>Rustproof</b> - invulnerable to water and rust. Metal items
        can be made rustproof by dipping them into a blessed oil of rust
        removal, or a (cursed) potion of oil. Few items are naturally
        rustproof - lead sling bullet, ring of the fish, amulet/helm of
        water breathing, and iron ore. </li>
      <li><b>Waterproof</b> - functionally identical to rustproof, but
        for non-metal items. Rust monsters ignore non-iron items.
        Waterproof items are created by dipping non-metal items into a
        potion of oil (may fail, cursed works best) or a blessed oil of
        rust removal. It makes sense only for scrolls and books, since
        other materials aren't damaged by water. </li>
      <li><b>Poisoned</b> - weapons, missiles and food items can be made
        poisoned by diping them into a potion of poison (any status).
        Weapons and missiles are denoted by (p) after the stats, instead
        of saying "poisoned", like for food items. Poisoned status wears
        off after few hits from poisoned weapons. Poisoned food can be
        used as a missile to poison monsters. The status always
        dissappears from missiles and food after they are fired,
        regardless of whether they hit or not. </li>
      <li><b>Cooked</b> - corpses improved by the Cooking skill, or Fire
        Bolt, Fireball or Improved Fireball spells. Also monster's fire
        breath can create cooked corpses. Their nutrition value is
        doubled, weight decreased by 5%, and rotting is 4x slower. </li>
      <li><b>Lit</b> - torches. You need to have both tinderbox and box
        with flint and steel with charges left to make a torch lit. A
        lit torch negates darkness, increases visibility radius by 3
        squares, and disables Stealth. A lit torch can't be in the
        backpack, however you can lit 3 torches at the same time - in
        both hands and in the tool slot. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Artifacts are mostly excluded from these statuses, except they
      can be poisoned by dipping them into a potion of poison and broken
      with a cursed scroll of repair. <small>Fixed in v1.2.0.</small></p>

    <p> Traps can be deliberately set off by standing on the trap and
      pressing <tt>Ctrl-t</tt>.</p>
    <p> It should be noted that traps affect monsters as well as the PC:
      light traps will blind monsters, corruption traps will corrupt
      monsters, acid traps will damage monsters, etc. An interesting use
      for an alarm trap is to lure a monster across it. Other monsters
      will become hostile towards the monster which triggered the trap
      and attack it. This can be very handy for disposing of cats (see
      section <a href="#0.9.2">0.9.2</a>).</p>
    <p> Traps can be discovered with the Detect Traps skill. PCs with
      this skill automatically apply it when the <tt>s</tt>earch
      command is used. In ordinary dungeons it is not worth using this
      technique, but in heavily trapped areas (the underground level of
      the Dwarven Graveyard, the Pyramid, the Assassin's Guild, the Mana
      temple) it is definitely prudent to use this skill multiple times
      during every turn where the PC suspects a trap is present.</p>
    <p> Traps are much easier to avoid once they are discovered,
      probably by a factor of 100 or more. This is why the Detect Traps
      skill is so useful. Every PC should attempt to gain this skill.
      Wands of trap detection can be used for this, but they run out of
      charges. They can be recharged of course, but the skill never runs
      out and is unaffected by the mana battery corruption.</p>
    <p> Note that it is not possible to use the <tt>w5</tt> (walk in
      place) command while standing on a trap.</p>
    <p> Finally, bear in mind that PCs with high Alertness, Mana,
      Dexterity attributes and the Sixth Sense talent will avoid
      undiscovered traps much more successfully than those without these
      abilities.</p>

    <h4>0.13.2.2 Trap pattern</h4>
    Traps occur in a known pattern. The order, left to right or top to
    bottom, is:
    <ul>
      <li>Light </li>
      <li>Corruption </li>
      <li>Stone block </li>
      <li>Alarm </li>
      <li>Arrow </li>
      <li>Acid </li>
      <li>Pit with vipers </li>
      <li>Spear </li>
      <li>Teleportation/Ceiling </li>
      <li>Water </li>
      <li>Fireball </li>
      <li>Simple Pit </li>
    </ul>
    <p> There are several places on fixed-layout levels where trap types
      and locations are shown in these documents. Note that trap types,
      in particular, are dependent upon the dungeon level where the
      fixed-layout level in question is generated. Examples include
      Dwarftown and (most of) the elemental temples. There is generally
      a warning in those sections concerning variations caused by
      differing dungeon level. There is also variability introduced if
      the player chooses to play with nonstandard resolution. There is
      no warning about this factor. Nevertheless, the above pattern
      applies; identifying a single trap allows the player to predict
      the type of trap generated elsewhere on the level.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.13.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.3 Doors <tt>/</tt><tt>+</tt></h4>
    There are doors on many of the dungeon room entrances. The majority
    of doors are not a problem, as you can easily <tt>o</tt>pen and <tt>c</tt>lose
    them. However, they can be locked or locked and trapped. Doors are
    generated with the following probabilities: open door: 45%, closed
    door: 25%, doorway (no door): 20%, locked only door: 3%, locked and
    trapped door: 7%.
    <p> <a name="0.13.3.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.3.1 Locked doors</h4>
    Locked doors can be opened using several methods. Safe ways are:
    <ul>
      <li>Unlocking with the proper blessed key - a message is
        generated: "You notice a clicking sound." meaning a trap was
        bypassed. Keys are randomly found in the dungeons. Skriek, the
        ratling in Lawenilothehl, also sells keys. You can unlock door
        with the unlock command - <tt>Ctrl-u</tt>, or you can just <tt>U</tt>se
        the correct key. </li>
      <li>Zapping blessed or uncursed wand knocking. </li>
      <li>Casting the Knock / Divine Key spell. </li>
      <li>Using the Silver Key, which is an artifact tool that can open
        all doors. </li>
      <li>Throwing an anvil or huge rock from some distance, unluckily
        this destroys the door (as opposed to simply opening it). And,
        in the case of the door being trapped, it also destroys the
        anvil/huge rock. </li>
      <li>Bypassing via digging or teleportation. </li>
      <li>Ordering a pet that can smash doors to walk through it. </li>
      <li>Using the Mindcrafter power Telekinetic Blast, this always
        destroys untrapped doors but has no effect on trapped ones. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Non-safe ways: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Kicking it down - some players recommend trying to open doors
        multiple times before kicking it, so as to set off any traps, as
        you really do not want be blind stunned and surrounded by
        multiple opponents. An unsuccessful attempt to kick down a
        non-trapped door yields the message "You kick the door but it
        does not budge." An unsuccessful attempt to kick down a trapped
        door yields the message "You kick the door but it does not budge
        at all." In this case the PC was extremely lucky, since kicking
        a trapped door almost invariably sets off the trap. </li>
      <li>Using uncursed and especially cursed keys - these might set
        off traps and break in process. </li>
      <li>Using the Pick Locks skill - this always sets of a trap if one
        is present. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Under some conditions player might want to lock doors to isolate
      part of the level or stop monsters from pursuing the character.
      Locked rooms are also recommended for storing items. General ways
      to lock (and sometimes also trap) a door are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a regular key of the correct type. Non blessed ones
        might break in the process. </li>
      <li>Using the Silver Key. </li>
      <li>Casting Magic Lock / Seal of the Spheres spell. </li>
      <li>Cursed wand of knocking will lock door. </li>
      <li>Applying the Pick Locks skill on unlocked door. This method
        has a chance to fail. </li>
      <li>Wand of door creation sometimes creates locked doors, which
        usually are trapped. Very unreliable. </li>
      <li>Wand of trap creation if <tt>z</tt>apped on "doorway" square
        will create trapped and locked door instead of conventional
        trap. Additionally zapping trap creation wand on present door
        will close and trap it. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.13.3.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.3.2 Trapped doors <tt>\</tt></h4>
    There are different types of door traps:

          <td>Booby trap </td>
          <td>Similar to the explosive rune trap, generates a fireball,

            Otherwise, 3d10-PV damage. </td>

        <tr>
          <td>Explosive rune</td>
          <td>Arguably the worst door trap, destroys a variety of worn

            companions, making them become hostile; a new effect in ADOM
            1.1.x+ is possible deafening of the PC. Damage dealt is
            (Min(DL+1,16)d6)*x/2, where x is 1 if you "partially evade
            the explosion" (depends on Dx and Luck) or 2 otherwise. </td>

            being stunned for (DLd4) turns. If you fail the roll, in
            addition to being stunned another roll (Pe+Luck)/30
            determines if you get blinded. In addition to the previous
            roll, there is a 1/30 chance to get heavily blinded for
            (DL*10d10) turns, otherwise it's just (DLd4)+DL turns. If

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p> Players should get into the habit of never standing directly in
      front of a door when opening it whenever possible. This will
      completely eliminate deaths from Stone block door traps and damage
      from Trick doors. It also lessens the damage from an Explosive
      rune: "You partially evade the explosion." As with ordinary traps,
      PCs with high Dexterity are more successful at evading door traps:
      "Suddenly a huge rock drops directly in front of the door! You
      barely evade it by jumping backwards!"</p>
    <p> If the PC has the Detect Traps skill, it is worth <tt>a</tt>pplying
      it a few times in the direction of closed doors, or simple <tt>s</tt>earching
      can be used as well.</p>
    <p> Unlike regular traps, the type of a discovered trapped door
      cannot be recognized neither by a color - it is always red, nor by
      looking around using <tt>l</tt>ook command. But it can be
      discovered by <tt>a</tt>pplying the Detect Traps skill in the
      direction of a known trapped door. Or, via calculating door
      pattern - see section 0.13.3.5 below.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.13.3.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.3.3 Secret doors</h4>
    Some doors are hidden and must be <tt>s</tt>earched for. A ring of
    searching will do this automatically. Dark Elves (5), Thieves (6),
    Orcs (10) and Dwarves (20) get bonus to finding secret doors.
    Alternatively, secret doors may be discovered by <tt>k</tt>icking
    them. Kicking a normal dungeon wall results in the message "You hurt
    your foot kicking the wall!". Kicking a concealed secret door
    results in the message "You really hurt your foot kicking the wall!"
    <p> <a name="0.13.3.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.3.4 Special door features</h4>
    Closed doors can be kicked down for wooden sticks, which can then be
    used for Fletchery. However, a destroyed door (either original or
    created) will leave an invisible doorstep, which has the following
    properties:
    <ul>
      <li>Herbs won't grow on a spot where once door had existed. </li>
      <li>Wand of digging won't create a pit on such a square. You get
        "Nothing happens" message. </li>
      <li>You may dig a hole with a pick axe, and cover it with a
        blanket and create regular trap. And then you may disarm it -
        the doorstep is still there. It doesn't matter if you disarm the
        trap with spell or with respective skill. </li>
      <li>Doorsteps aren't affected by wand of destruction. It doesn't
        make any difference if you destruct the door, or kick it down
        and <tt>z</tt>ap the wand of destruction afterwards. </li>
      <li>Wand of trap creation will often recreate a trapped door on
        such a square, instead of regular trap. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.13.3.5"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.3.5 Door pattern</h4>
    As with traps, door locks and door traps occur in a known pattern.
    Notice that door keys and door traps have pattern of six, which
    leads to fact that all doors with same key on same level can have
    only one trap type.
    <p> The order, left to right or top to bottom, is: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Round lock - Stunning rune </li>
      <li>Triangular lock - Flash trap </li>
      <li>Hexagonal lock - Trick door trap </li>
      <li>Small lock - Booby trap </li>
      <li>Tiny lock - Stone block trap </li>
      <li>Square lock - Explosive rune </li>
    </ul>
    <p> The trap type holds for the entire Infinite Dungeon. For Caverns
      of Chaos, D:1 round doors have Trick door traps. D:2 round doors
      have Booby traps, D:3 Stone blocks etc. For other locations, door
      trap patterns have not yet been investigated.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.13.3.6"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.3.6 Monsters who can smash doors</h4>
    The following is a list of monsters that can break doors:<br>
    dragons and wyrms of all colors and sizes, ogres, giants, minotaurs,
    golems, titans, slayers, turtles, balors and molochs of all types.
    Additionally: annihilator, (big) casino guard, bulette, burly
    adventurer, cat lord, caveman, chaos warlord, dark orc, Dorn Beast,
    dwarven (elite) guardian, emperor lich, eternal guardian, giant
    boar, greater earth elemental, lich king, old barbarian, orc
    butcher, revenant, sheriff, snake from beyond, stone statue, undead
    chaos dwarven berserker, writhing mass of primal chaos.

    <h4>0.13.4 Rooms</h4>
    <a name="0.13.4.1"></a>
    <h4>0.13.4.1 Dark rooms</h4>
    Dark rooms, and dark areas in general, are just that - dark. They
    are problematic since approaching enemies can't be seen. It is also
    possible to inadvertantly kill a creature in a dark room. The
    darkness can be permanently dispelled with the Light spell or a wand
    of light. A torch or an amulet of light provides a temporary light
    source. If a doomed PC enters a dark room, there is a 1 in 1000
    chance of being instakilled by a grue each turn. See section <a
      href="#0.15.5">0.15.5</a> for more detailed information about
    darkness.
    <p> <a name="0.13.4.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.4.2 Tension rooms</h4>
    Tension rooms have 1/5 chance to be generated.
    <p> Tension rooms are relatively small rooms filled with monsters.
      They always have doors that cause the walls around them to
      crumble. This allows the monsters within to swarm the PC. They can
      be filled with monsters of one type, two separate types or a
      variety of different monsters. Mixed tension rooms in particular
      can contain out-of-depth monsters. Since the level message "You
      sense a certain tension." is always associated with these rooms,
      the PC is forewarned. It is prudent to find out what is in the
      tension room with a wand of monster detection, especially at
      deeper dungeon levels. It is quite possible to be faced with a
      ghost king and ancient karmic dragon simultaneously from such a
      room.</p>
    <p> PCs that are blinded by a trap whilst breaking into a tension
      room can still try to identify what monsters they are facing from
      the message generated, as this tends to usually relate to a sound
      or feeling rather than a sight: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a multitude of angry sounds: mixed tension room </li>
      <li>many squeaking sounds: rats </li>
      <li>yelping war cries: kobolds </li>
      <li>hoots and wails: hobgoblins and goblins </li>
      <li>orcish battle cries: orcs </li>
      <li>high-pitched grunts: gnolls </li>
      <li>many howling sounds: wolves </li>
      <li>an enormous stench of decay: lesser undead </li>
      <li>a flood of chilling terror: ghosts </li>
      <li>this shop seems to be deserted: mimics </li>
    </ul>
    <a name="0.13.4.3"></a>
    <h4>0.13.4.3 Threatening rooms</h4>
    Threatening rooms have 1/8 chance to be generated if DL&gt;7.
    <p> A new variant of tension rooms has appeared in ADOM 1.0.0+. The
      level message "You suddenly feel threatened." is generated on
      levels containing these rooms. These rooms are similar to tension
      rooms, but are always filled with a single type of monster. In
      addition, they do not have the crumbling walls feature of tension
      rooms.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.13.4.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.4.4 Trap rooms</h4>
    Trap rooms have 1/50 chance to be generated, or 1/10 if Doomed.
    <p> If the message "You shudder" is created upon entering a new
      dungeon level, one of the rooms on that level will have a trap on
      each square. Care should be taken to locate this room as soon as
      possible. Monsters that don't fly or hover will activate the traps
      if they stumble in such a room. It is possible for a threat room
      to be the same as the trap room. Watch the carnage.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.13.5"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.5 Special rooms and their effects</h4>
    Special messages rooms are dungeon rooms with either a one-time
    effect on the PC or a permanent unique effect that affects the PC
    (or other monsters) as long as they remain on one of the tiles of
    the room. However some messages have no effect whatsoever.

    Herbs have 1/6 chance to be generated if DL&gt;2, no altar, no
    forge.
    <p> <a name="0.13.6.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.6.1 Herbs growth</h4>
    Herb bushes are always found in the Big Room (level 6 of the Caverns
    of Chaos). They grow according to Conway's Life rules. They are as
    follows:
    <ul>
      <li>If the bush has 0 or 1 neighboring bush, it will die in the
        next generation. </li>
      <li>If the bush has 2 or 3 neighboring bushes, it will survive
        through the next generation. </li>
      <li>If the bush has 4 neighboring bushes, it will die in the next
        generation. </li>
      <li>If an empty dungeon square has 3 neighboring bushes, a new
        bush will grow during the next generation. </li>
      <li>Births and deaths are simultaneous. </li>
    </ul>
    ADOM adds to this: there are 1d1000 turns between generations. If a
    bush has two neighbors, it will remain the same during the next
    generation. If a bush has three neighbors, it will gain strength
    during the next generation. These additions are important, since
    there are many stable patterns, but very few that will continue to
    blossom over time. For instance the following patterns are stable:
    <p> </p>
    <pre>                                       *     *
                                      * *   * *
                                      * *    *
                                       *
</pre>
    but are quite useless as far as ADOM is concerned. Since none of the
    bushes has three neighbors, once they reach a withered state they
    will never recover. The best pattern to create for farming herbs in
    ADOM is a 2 x 2 square of herbs. This will remain alive indefinitely
    and generate more herb blossoms every generation. It is also worth
    preserving a 1 x 3 pattern. This is a pattern that oscillates
    between horizontal and vertical. Since two of the herb bushes are
    new each generation and therefore unpicked, they will constantly be
    renewed. The danger with this pattern is overharvesting. If one bush
    dies, they all die. The square 2 x 2 pattern does not have this
    liability. If one (and only one) bush dies, it will be filled in the
    next generation.
    <p> Herbs apparently require light to survive. A message "It's dark
      here! Some herb bushes full of blossoms are growing here. The
      vegetation beneath your feet shrivels and suddenly is gone." has
      been observed.</p>
    <p> Herbs can be generated on any dungeon level by <tt>U</tt>sing a
      potion of holy water on a dungeon square, even for PCs without the
      Gardening skill. The success rate is 33%. Note that while any
      dungeon level will work, only those levels which already had herbs
      will support herb growth. In other words, herbs will not undergo
      the normal growth cycle unless the dungeon level had indigenous
      herbs. Consequently, the PC should avoid creating herbs in this
      manner unless the dungeon level already has herbs, unless it is a
      matter of life or death. The exception is PCs that have the
      Gardening skill. <tt>A</tt>pplying the Gardening skill with herb
      seeds causes a dungeon level to transform to an herb-sustaining
      state.</p>

      creating especially desirable herbs.</p>

    <h4>0.13.6.2 Picking herbs</h4>
    The strength of a particular herb bush can be determined by <tt>a</tt>pplying
    Herbalism skill. Three strengths are recognized: full of blossoms,
    strong, and withered. If is safe to pick up a herb full of blossoms
    or strong, but a withered herb may disappear after next pick up.
    There is Herbalism / 1d160 chance for the bush to not lower in
    status; so 3/8 of the time the bush will still go down at 100
    Herbalism. The status of the herb picked is determined as follows:
    if Herbalism &gt; 1d110 = Uncursed, THEN (only if it passed the
    first check) if Herbalism &gt; 1d140 = Blessed. Level 18+ Farmers
    now have a 50% chance of anything cursed turning uncursed at this
    point, immediatelly followed by a 50% chance for uncursed to become
    blessed. Non-farmers get about 65% blessed herbs, 26% uncursed, and
    9% cursed at 100 Herbalism; level 18+ Farmers should get around
    80.5% blessed, 15% uncursed, and 4.5% cursed.

    <h4>0.13.7 Shops</h4>
    Shops have 1/4 chance to be generated for Merchants, 1/6 chance for
    others. Pickup items from shop freely (<tt>,</tt>, <tt>;</tt>, <tt>Ctrl-p</tt>),
    but don't forget to <tt>p</tt>ay for them. Use <tt>:p</tt> to pay
    for all items. Press <tt>P</tt> to see how much gold you currently
    owe. To sell, just <tt>d</tt>rop (or <tt>:d</tt>rop) your stuff to
    the shop floor. Check your purse with <tt>$</tt>.
    <p> The <a href="adomman-R.html#R1">ADOM
        Manual</a> provides some basic information about shops. Shops
      are rooms in the dungeons inhabited by shopkeepers and stocked
      with their wares. Shops can be general stores selling a variety of
      items or specialty stores selling only one type of item. Shops
      should always be entered and explored, since viewing the items in
      a shop permanently identifies them.</p>
    <p> Certain powerful items are less likely to be generated in shops.
      These include wand of wishing (8x), scroll of chaos resistance
      (12x), ring of djinni summoning (5x), potion of cure corruption
      (6x), potion of gain attributes (40x), potion of attribute (30x),
      potion of potential attribute (20x), potion of water (2x). </p>
    <p> Shopkeepers will restock their inventory if it is depleted or
      appears to be depleted. It is a good idea to pick up everything in
      a shop and drop the unwanted items on one square. This gives the
      shopkeeper room to restock. Note that it is necessary for a
      certain amount of game time to pass in order for a shop to
      restock. PCs with sufficient Perception scores and Listening skill
      levels will hear a message "You hear arcane mumbling." which means
      a depleted shop has been restocked.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.13.7.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.7.1 Guaranteed shops</h4>
    There are five guaranteed shops in the game:
    <ul>
      <li>Munxip's food store in Terinyo - <a href="#1.2.6">1.2.6</a>
      </li>
      <li>Barnabas' general shop in Lawenilothehl - <a href="#1.3.2"
         >1.3.2</a> </li>
      <li>Waldenbrook's general shop in Dwarftown - <a href="#3.5.1"
         >3.5.1</a> </li>
      <li>Leggot's general shop in the High Mountain Village - <a
          "#2.1.4"="">2.1.4</a> </li>
      <li>Great Gift Shoppe in the Casino - <a href="#3.13">3.13</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Shopkeepers generally buy items as well as selling them. The
      exception is the Casino shop, which only sells. Specialty
      storekeepers are only interested in purchasing the items they
      specialize in. Sell Munxip those useless kobold corpses!</p>

    <h4>0.13.7.3 Shopkeepers' racial prejudices</h4>
    Shopkeepers have definite racial prejudices in addition to the
    special criteria Munxip (see sections <a href="#1.2.2">1.2.2, 1.2.6</a>) and Barnabas (see sections <a href="#1.3.1">1.3.1, 1.3.2</a>) use. Malte Helmert has done some testing regarding this
    and observed the following: The HMV and Lawenilothehl shops were
    generated 50 times each. The races of the shopkeepers were:
    <ul>
      <li>Barnabas: 15x Human, 14x Orc, 13x Troll, 8x Gnome </li>
      <li>Leggot: 18x Human, 14x Troll, 9x Gnome, 9x Dwarf </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Other races may be possible, with a very low probability.</p>
    <p> Quoting Malte's findings:</p>
    <p> "The following chart lists the percentage of the "base value"
      offered by a shopkeeper of the race specified in the column to a
      PC of the race specified in the row. 100% is normal, 110% is
      possible if the shopkeeper likes the PC's race very much (mostly
      if both are of the same race), and the value can become as low as
      10% if the shopkeeper really hates the PC's race.</p>
    <p> "Looking at the chart, you see that all non-Hurthling
      shopkeepers prefer PCs of the same race. Hurthlings are the only
      shopkeeper race that isn't prejudiced, and Hurthlings are also the
      best-liked PC race (there is no race that gives Hurthlings a
      really bad deal, and many give them excellent deals).</p>
    <p> "Considering the fact that the most important shopkeeper in the
      game is a Dwarf (Waldenbrook), Orcish and especially Dark Elven
      PCs appear to have the worst time (this is not news, of course)."</p>

    <h4>0.13.7.4 Robbing shops</h4>
    Shops can be robbed. This of course has effects on alignment, in
    addition to putting the PC's life at risk. These shopkeepers are
    maintaining a business in a highly dangerous environment and are
    well suited to dealing with those who choose to steal from them. In
    addition to their own very tough nature, they can summon hordes of
    thugs who attack the PC. Shopkeepers are able to detect invisible
    PCs. The message "-Shopkeeper- stares at your position with great
    intensity." indicates they have detected and are looking at an
    invisible PC. However, this does not happen instantly. Therefore,
    invisibility can be used to rob shops without making the shopkeeper
    hostile. The PC can enter a shop while invisible and pick up items.
    Anything the invisible PC picks up <i>prior</i> to generation of
    the above message can be taken from the shop safely. Therefore, the
    usual technique is to enter the shop while visible, gather up
    everything in the shop and drop it all as close to the door as
    possible. The PC can then become invisible, pick up everything and
    leave the shop undetected as long as the above message is not
    generated.
    <p> Another technique for robbing shops is available for those PCs
      who have pets or slaves under good control. If a shop is entered
      and nothing is picked up, the shopkeeper does not block the door.
      The PC can order his pet or slave to stand in the doorway, pick up
      whatever is desired, then <tt>:s</tt>wap positions with the pet
      or slave. At that point, getting away with the loot is simply a
      matter of outrunning the shopkeeper and avoiding or killing any
      summoned thugs.</p>
    <p> A PC with the Teleportation spell can teleport a shopkeeper out
      of his shop. Shopkeepers are teleportation resistant, so trying
      this with a wand is usually not successful and a waste of the
      wand's charges. This results in a hostile shopkeeper and summoned
      thugs, however. Since it is impossible to choose the destination
      of the shopkeeper, this is a dangerous technique unless the PC is
      experienced enough to deal with a hostile shopkeeper and the thugs
      he will summon.</p>
    <p> A hostile shopkeeper can use his thrown coin attack only once.</p>

    <h4>0.13.8 Rivers <tt>=</tt></h4>
    Rivers have 1/15 chance to be generated.
    <p> Introduced in gamma 14, these can be found in the High Kings
      cave, Puppy Cave, Druid Dungeon, CoC, ID, UD (Rift?). Like any
      body of water, they can rust unprotected iron items, drench
      scrolls and spellbooks and drown the PC. Drowning damage seems be
      dependent on HPs, with high-HP PCs taking proportionally more
      damage. Precautions include waterproof blankets, a high Swimming
      skill, water breathing gear (see section <a href="#0.12.1.7">0.12.1.7</a>),
      rustproofing iron items, casting Earthquake (ceiling rubble can
      create land bridges), freezing the water (see next paragraph),
      teleportation, trap creation (for teleportation trap), and Bridge
      Building.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.13.8.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.8.1 Freezing water</h4>
    Pretty straightforward: use some cold source while standing next to
    a water square and zap over it. Frost/Nether Bolt, Ice Ball/Freezing
    Fury, or a wand of cold qualify. Ice is fragile, of course, and
    there's a 2000 stone limit for your stuff's weight. Exploding ice
    vortices will freeze all water in the range of their blast.
    Likewise, monsters that cast Frost Bolt, ogre magi for instance, can
    freeze water. However, monsters that breathe ice, white dragons for
    example, do not freeze anything when their breath crosses water
    (probably a bug).
    <p> <a name="0.13.9"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.9 Pools <tt>0</tt></h4>
    Pools have 1/6 chance to be generated, if no altar, no forge, no
    herbs.
    <p> <tt>D</tt>rinking from pools can do various magical things to a
      PC: one can gain or lose any intrinsic (except water breathing,
      confusion and sickness resistance) or unnatural aging. It is very
      possible to be corrupted by drinking from pools. Also, hostile
      snakes or water elementals can come out of pools. The most
      hunted-for ability of pools is the small chance of getting a wish.
      It has been rumored that pools with the color of the PC's eyes are
      the most beneficial.</p>
    <p> Strictly speaking, when a PC drinks from a pool there is a roll
      for 52 possible effects. The first two effects listed ('pool dries
      up' and 'writhing with snakes') are much more common than the rest
      of the effects and have a 8/52 and 5/52 chance, respectively. The
      other effects each have a 1/52 chance.</p>
    <p> For the vast majority of the intrinsics are lost if a PC is
      having them and gained them if not (intrinsic toggle). This makes
      pools much nicer for characters without many intrinsics already.
      There is 1/104 chance to receive a wish (as long as PC is not
      doomed). The pool inside the Stone Circle always corrupts by
      10d100 CP's in addition to the normal effect.</p>

    <h4>0.13.10 Forges <tt>&amp;</tt></h4>
    Forges have 1/8 chance to be generated if DL&gt;5.
    <p> Forges are the basic pre-requisite for smithing - you also need
      an anvil, an item to improve, a hammer and an ingot of the
      appropriate metal. See <a href="#0.15.4">0.15.4</a> for more
      about Smithing.</p>
    <p> A forge is near-guaranteed to be found in the UD, and guaranteed
      places to find some include Dwarftown and Darkforge.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.13.11"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.11 Hives <tt>*</tt><tt>0</tt></h4>
    Hives are holes in the floor of the dungeon containing hive
    creatures, either ants or bees. Their population is finite. There is
    a guaranteed ant hive on level two of the Puppy Cave, and a
    guaranteed bee hive before the Banshee level in CoC.
    <p> <a name="0.13.11.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.11.1 Ants <tt>a</tt></h4>
    Ant hives are filled with giant ant workers, giant ant warriors and
    a giant ant queen. The player is alerted to an ant hive by hearing
    "clicking sounds". They are simply a source of monsters to be killed
    with no particular reward associated with clearing the hive. Bear in
    mind that ants dig. Leaving them alone and allowing them to dig can
    be exploited as a source of rocks and possibly gems. Ant corpses are
    sources of acid resistance.
    <p> Huge rocks can be used to keep ants from escaping anthills. When
      an ant attempts to leave an anthill covered by a huge rock, the
      message "The uncursed huge rock (-10, 10d6) seems to be shaking."
      is generated. Eventually the huge rock is destroyed ("Something
      from below destroys the uncursed huge rock (-10, 10d6)!") and ants
      can come out of the hole again. Sometimes this happens after only
      a few turns, sometimes it takes more than a hundred. Multiple huge
      rocks are destroyed one after another and thus last longer than a
      single one.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.13.11.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.11.2 Bees <tt>b</tt></h4>
    Bee hives are filled with giant bee workers, giant bee warriors and
    a giant bee queen. The player is alerted by hearing "buzzing
    sounds". They are a source of beeswax, which can be <tt>u</tt>sed
    to plug the PCs ears. This deafens the PC and is one way to survive
    the Banshee level. A bee hive is guaranteed to be generated before
    the Banshee's level. They are also a potential source of gelee
    royal, which when eaten has a variety of beneficial effects: it is
    very nourishing, heals, increases Appearance and cures poisoning.
    All of these beneficial effects will not be experienced
    simultaneously, of course. Bees have a poisonous attack, which kills
    the attacking bee. Kicking the hive will cause the bees to become
    enraged and swarm the PC. Kicking the hive apparently increases the
    chance of gelee royal generation, although it is not guaranteed. In
    ADOM 1.1.1, bees generated by <tt>k</tt>icking the hive are
    considered summoned and therefore cannot be sacrificed. This may
    well be a bug. Be careful of this if you are relying on an altar to
    get rid of bees.

    <h4>0.13.12 Vaults</h4>
    Vaults are large rooms, larger than tension rooms. Depending on the
    variety, they can be nearly completely filled with monsters or only
    partially filled. They vary in danger from moderate (a lesser vault
    full of gnolls and hyenas), a challenge for PCs less than experience
    level ten, to absolutely deadly (a greater vault full of greater
    undead), a challenge for experience level 50 PCs who have already
    won the game.
    <p> <a name="0.13.12.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.12.1 Lesser vaults</h4>
    <a href="adomgb-0-13-lvaults.html">Examples
      of lesser vaults</a>
    <p> Lesser vaults generally take up about 1/4 of the screen with an
      80 x 25 display. They come in every imaginable flavor, from gnolls
      and hyenas to lesser undead to a variety of berserkers. Their
      danger level is relatively low, comparable to a mixed tension room
      on the same level. The level message "You feel excited." is always
      generated when the PC enters a dungeon level containing a lesser
      vault.</p>
    <p> There is one guaranteed lesser vault, on level six of the Puppy
      Cave.</p>

    <h4>0.13.12.2 Greater vaults</h4>
    <a href="adomgb-0-13-gvaults.html">Examples
      of greater vaults</a>
    <p> Greater vaults are unmistakable. They appear in the CoC beyond
      the wall of flames. They take up half of a standard dungeon level.
      The level message "You feel truly excited." is always generated
      when the PC enters a dungeon level containing a greater vault. It
      is wise to immediately <tt>z</tt>ap a wand of monster detection
      to determine the type of vault. They come in a variety of types,
      including fire creatures, giants, undead, and karmics. Greater
      undead and karmic greater vaults are particularly challenging.
      Some players will simply ignore greater vaults of greater undead,
      even with experience level 50 PCs. This is despite the fact that
      the rewards for clearing a greater vault are considerable. They
      generally contain one or two artifacts along with substantial
      amounts of gold, usually well over 100,000 gold pieces. This is in
      addition to any equipment that the monsters might drop, which is
      considerable in the case of a greater vault full of dragons. The
      amount of experience points available from clearing a greater
      vault is also huge.</p>
    <p> PCs using good effectivity Frost Bolt or Fire Bolt generally
      have a fairly easy time clearing fire- or cold-based creatures,
      respectively. However, these ranged spells also destroy some of
      the equipment dropped by the monsters. High level Mindcrafters
      also have a relatively easy time with greater vaults (as long as
      they are not undead!). Casting Confusion Wave followed by
      (Greater) Mental Wave will clear a vault quickly, no muss, no fuss
      and no equipment destruction. Clearing a greater vault with a pure
      fighter is much more tedious.</p>
    <p> There are no guaranteed greater vaults in the game. <small>In
        v1.2.0, there is a guaranteed greater vault on D:45 or D:46.</small></p>

    <h4>0.13.13 Royal treasuries <tt>$</tt><tt>$</tt><tt>$</tt></h4>
    Royal treasuries are small hidden rooms generally found in the upper
    parts of the CoC. Their presence is indicated by the "You hear the
    steps of the royal guard." or "You hear the sound of falling coins."
    level messages. They are disconnected from the rest of the rooms on
    the level and thus can only be entered by tunneling or
    teleportation. Scroll of gold detection can be used to identify the
    location of royal treasury. The royal guard within will not be
    hostile towards PCs that simply pick up the gold. Attacking the
    royal guard is not really worthwhile. It does not curse or doom, but
    is a chaotic act. Note that eating the corpse of a royal guard
    curses the PC. Also note that chatting with the royal guard after
    picking up some gold will make him hostile.
    <p> <small>In v1.2+, the royal guardian will turn hostile if the PC
        picks any gold.</small> <a name="0.13.14"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.14 Altars <tt>_</tt></h4>
    Altars have 1/9 chance to be generated.
    <p> There are three types of altars: lawful, neutral, and chaotic.
      They can be used to sacrifice items and monsters to the Gods.
      There is a guaranteed altar in Dwarftown. There are also
      guaranteed chaotic altars in each of the elemental temples. Refer
      to section <a href="#0.2.3">0.2.3</a> for a more complete
      discussion about altars.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.13.15"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.15 Graves <tt>+</tt></h4>
    Graves are only found in two locations in the game: the Dwarven
    Graveyard (<a href="#2.7.1">2.7.1</a>), and the CoC Graveyard
    (<a "#3.8"="">3.8</a>).
    <p> Most of the graves are not of much importance, but some of them
      will contain the inscription "Great treasures are buried here."
      These graves contain 1d10+5 items, other graves contain 1d6-4 (min
      0) items. It is indeed possible to find an outstanding item, up to
      and including artifacts, but it is rare. Digging up graves is a
      chaotic act, which causes an alignment drop of 100, and will
      always summon some kind of guardian. The monsters that can spawn
      from a regular grave are chosen randomly from the following:
      vampire, skeleton, skeletal warrior, corpse fiend, mummy, greater
      mummy, lich, wraith, wight, ghul, zombie, spectre, shadow, and
      ghost. For "great treasures" grave, there is 5/6 chance for master
      lich, 5/36 chance for lich king, and 1/36 chance for the dreaded
      emperor lich.</p>
    <p> Graves have a pattern, similar to that of traps or doors. The
      pattern is: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Great treasures are buried here. </li>
      <li>R.I.P. </li>
      <li>His steps were light, short his sight, great his pains, few
        his remains. </li>
      <li>Nameless stranger. </li>
      <li>R.I.P. </li>
      <li>J.F.K. </li>
      <li>R.I.P. </li>
      <li>May thy soul rest in peace. </li>
      <li>S.A.C. </li>
      <li>Unknown. </li>
      <li>He never was a valiant man, now he fits into a tiny can. </li>
      <li>R.I.P. </li>
      <li>Eternal pain be thine! </li>
      <li>R.I.P. </li>
      <li>V.D. </li>
      <li>Pelegar, 1162--1447 </li>
      <li>R.I.P. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> The pattern shifts by three items to the left for next row,
      unlike traps/doors, which shift just 1 item. It could be used by
      characters with low Literacy to find great treasures graves.
      Reading graves probably trains Literacy a bit.</p>
    <p> All of this regarding digging graves assumes the PC has a means
      of digging. The available methods are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>pickaxe - there is a guaranteed pickaxe in the Pyramid for PCs
        at experience level 13 - 16 (see section <a href="#2.9">2.9</a>)
      </li>
      <li>wand of digging - direction <tt>5</tt> </li>
      <li>Mystic Shovel / Divine Digger spell - direction <tt>5</tt> </li>
      <li>failing to read a spellbook can sometimes dig grave - see <a
          "#0.5.1.5"="">0.5.1.5</a> </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.13.16"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.16 Cavernous levels</h4>
    Cavernous levels are a particular type of level that features large
    circular rooms occasionally interspersed with short connecting
    corridors. Cavernous levels tend to be considerably more dangerous
    than normal levels because monster generation rate is much faster,
    and it is easy to get surrounded. Most dungeon features cannot occur
    in cavernous levels, the exceptions being altars, hives, surges of
    power and threat rooms, i.e. rooms that happen to lack the actual
    walls holding the monsters in. In this form they are much more
    dangerous than on normal levels: they feature a large (often 25-40)
    number of levelled creatures of the same type that will engage the
    PC once spotted, and, due to their large numbers, close proximity,
    and the open spaces, can be very difficult to handle, particularly
    if the denizens of the open threat rooms are summoners, vortices, or
    otherwise dangerous monsters such as diamond golems.
    <p> Although the design of cavernous levels is not fixed (from their
      appearance, they are probably modified regular levels), their
      locations generally are. The following is a list of all cavernous
      levels in ADOM:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the fifth level of the Puppy Cave </li>
      <li>levels 3-5 of the Tomb of the High Kings </li>
      <li>two levels of the Caverns of Chaos, typically around D:37 and
        D:44 </li>
      <li>all levels of the Blue Dragon Caves </li>
      <li>all levels of the Scintillating Cave except for the last level
      </li>
      <li>the Big Room shares the main features of cavernous levels -
        wide open spaces and high monster generation - but is not a
        proper cavernous level because of its fixed, clearly non-natural
        size and shape and the guaranteed presence of herbs (to the
        exclusion of other dungeon features) </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.13.17"></a></p>
    <h4>0.13.17 Webs <tt>|</tt></h4>
    Webs are a semi-permanent dungeon feature that can trap either the
    PC or monsters imposing significant penalties on their actions. Webs
    are never randomly generated on levels - they can only be created
    either by the PC (the Web spell or a wand of webbing) or various
    spider-type monsters <tt>S</tt>. Each web occupies a single floor
    tile and will remain there indefinitely until it is destroyed. Webs
    can not be created on a tile already containing a herb plant or a
    trap - this can be used to create stable herb fams, and for trap
    detection. Webs likewise can not be created on non-dungeon floor
    tiles, staircases, doors, and over water.
    <p> The PC will always be caught in a web whenever (s)he moves on a
      webbed floor tile either physically from neighboring tiles or by
      teleportation. While the PC is trapped in webs (s)he can not
      perform the majority of standard actions - typically the only
      thing to do is to try to break from webs (by moving in any
      direction). The chances of the PC to break from a web are
      dependent on his/her Strength score. Breaking from webs trains
      Strength, if it is lower than 15. When the PC gets caught in webs
      and each time (s)he tries to break free and fails (s)he may got
      bitten by a swarm of tiny spiders. This will poison the PC if
      (s)he does not have poison resistance and will do nothing (except
      generate a corresponding message) otherwise. Dark elven PCs are
      immune to this poison and will instead "welcome his/her spidery
      friends". After the PC breaks from webs on a floor tile they are
      destroyed.</p>
    <p> Monsters that move on a webbed floor tile have a chance to get
      caught. Trapped monsters will attempt to break free each turn and
      will be unable to move/attack the PC or use their abilities. It
      should be noted that monsters breaking free from webs will
      move/attack on the same turn. Various monsters simply ignore webs
      and will never be caught while moving on a webbed tile. These
      mainly include spider-type creatures, all dark elves, most
      constructs and undead. Fire creatures and incredibly strong
      monsters (like molochs) will immediately destroy webs while moving
      on a webbed tile without losing a turn. The majority of monsters
      are, however, vulnerable to webs. It should be noted that due to
      the high chance to evade webbing shot from a wand or spell and the
      high chance to simply avoid being caught in the webs, using webs
      as a disabler requires preparations. The most efficient way to
      utilize webs is to fill a large area/long corridor completely,
      alert the monster to the PC's presence, teleport over the webbed
      tiles and resort to missile attacks while the monsters try to
      cover the "minefield". Due to the fact that monsters can break
      free from webs and move/attack the PC on the same turn using melee
      attacks is a risky tactic.</p>
    <p> Webs can be destroyed by fire/lightning/acid-based attacks
      performed by the PC and monsters, and likewise fire/lightning/acid
      vortices will immediately destroy any web that they move into.
      Webs will be destroyed on all levels of the Tower of Eternal
      Flames and in the Water Dragon Cave.</p>

    <h4>0.14.1 Recharging wands <tt>\</tt></h4>
    There are many ways to recharge a depleted wand. The common ways are
    to dip <tt>!</tt> the wand into an appropriate potion or <tt>r</tt>ead
    a scroll of charging. Only the type of potion and its status affects
    the number of charges. The type, status and rusty/nonrusty nature of
    the wand do not matter. See the table below for some results

    <p> Remember that a potentially endless supply of booze is available
      from beggars in Lawenilothehl. Give them 50 gold pieces, then <tt>C</tt>hat
      with them and they will often drop a potion of booze. Only one per
      beggar, though, so those who have given up their potion need to be
      killed (alignment hit) or led into the wilderness to encourage
      more beggar generation. Get rid of all the other random monsters
      in the town to further encourage monster generation.</p>
    <p> Potions of raw mana do not work. Note that potions of mana can
      be used to permanently increase the PCs Mana attribute; the player
      may want to save them for that purpose. Wizards can also recharge
      wands at level 32, only once per wand though. Wands of wishing
      can't be recharged. For these, you'll want to use the chance to
      wrench a final charge from the wand, destroying it. See also
      potions of raw chaos below.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.14.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.14.2 Huge rocks and anvils <tt>*</tt> <tt>]</tt></h4>
    These heavy items have a nice use: crashing doors. Throw one at a
    door and enjoy the sight of a broken door before you. This is not
    guaranteed; it seems to be Strength dependent. There is a very nice
    side benefit to this: any trap that the door was protected with is
    destroyed along with the door. The trap does not go off as it is
    destroyed.
    <p> In addition, huge rocks can be used to keep ants from escaping
      anthills. Whenever an ant wants to escape, you get a message like
      "The uncursed huge rock (-10, 10d6) seems to be shaking.".
      Eventually the huge rock is destroyed ("Something from below
      destroys the uncursed huge rock (-10, 10d6)!") and ants can come
      out of the hole again. Sometimes this happens after only a few
      turns, sometimes it takes more than a hundred. Multiple huge rocks
      are destroyed one after the other and thus last longer than a
      single one.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.14.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.14.3 Statues <tt>]</tt></h4>
    If your PC is really, really buff, a statue can be wielded as a
    melee weapon, but the real use for statues is to <tt>k</tt>ick it
    until it breaks down, making it yield a magical wand. Statues can be
    generated by petrifying enemies. If a PC has a PV below four, she
    will take damage from kicking statues (and walls).
    <p> Stephen White has done some research on the B/U/C status of
      statues re wand generation. His PC kicked 200 statues with each
      status to pieces. The results were as follows: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>blessed statues: 62 wands generated, about 1/3<br>
      </li>
      <li>uncursed statues: 17 wands generated, about 1/10<br>
      </li>
      <li>cursed statues: 3 wands generated, about 1/100
        <p> </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.14.4"></a></p>
    <h4>0.14.4 Potions of raw chaos <tt>!</tt></h4>
    Items can be dipped in potions of raw chaos in order to transform
    them into new ones, but will not make wands of wishing or rings of
    djinni summoning. Everything created will be cursed. Dipping items
    (other than artifacts) into a PoRC will transform it into a random
    item of the same type - useful for brass items. Equipped items are
    removed (even if cursed) and cursed. There is a chance of spilling
    the potion, though, which corrupts the PC (spilling happens if
    1d(Dx+10) &gt; Dx). Worse is the possibility of transforming an item
    into the exact same item. This causes an explosion which badly
    corrupts the PC, about 5 corruptions (100d100 CP's), and causes
    10d30 of damage. Needless to say, this can kill a low-level PC.
    Dipping a scroll of chaos resistance into potion of raw chaos causes
    a massive explosion of 13d13 damage, producing death message 'was
    ripped apart when confronting Order and Chaos'.
    <p> PoRC will only create items of a danger level that corresponds
      to the level on which you dip the item. For creating an amulet of
      lifesaving, you should dip amulets on DL2. Your odds are poor -
      1.08%. You can safely dip amulets of balance, free action, health,
      hunger, luck, chaos, order, speed, teleport control, cold hearts,
      water breathing, silver tongue, and mana.</p>
    <p> Wands dipped into a PoRC will turn into a wand with a different
      number of charges. This is one way to recharge wands with 0
      charges left. The type of wand, however, is unpredictable.</p>
    <p> A heap of items that are dipped into a potion of raw chaos will
      always transform into a single item. Potions of raw chaos can be
      created by dipping any corrupting artifact (those containing the
      essence of chaos and corruption + Moon Sickle) into any ordinary
      potion.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.14.5"></a></p>
    <h4>0.14.5 Potions of exchange <tt>!</tt></h4>
    In addition to swapping attributes, these can polymorph monsters
    when thrown. Blessed potions can polymorph items to another of the
    same type. Spellbooks are always transformed into non-spellbooks and
    vice versa. The item produced will be appropriate for the danger
    level where the dipping takes place. This is the basis of ring-based
    wish engines. Once one has blessed potions of exchange stacks of 19
    rings can be dipped, potentially producing 19 rings of djinni
    summoning. These in turn are enough to produce 57 more potions of
    exchange on average. Since used rings of djinni summoning become
    brass rings, additional rings do not have to be wished for. The PC
    may have to throw in some wishes for potions of water to keep
    blessing the potions of exchange. Of course once the engine starts
    there are enough spare wishes to actually get some things that
    matter as well. :-).
    <p> <a name="0.14.6"></a></p>
    <h4>0.14.6 Regeneration of HP and PP</h4>
    When drinking potions of insight or casting the Revelation spell,
    there is some information about Power Point and Hit Point
    regeneration. Those two values lie between 5 and 200: the lower the
    number, the faster the regeneration. But there are 2 variables
    connected to regeneration: RegenRate and RegenAmount. RegenRate is
    how often (in turns) you heal - this value is revealed via
    revelation or insight; RegenAmount is how much - this value is
    completely hidden.
    <p> Regeneration occurs at the same rate whether walking around or
      resting. RegenRate is measured in turns, not game time. High speed
      or seven league boots lead to exactly the same regeneration rate
      in turns. Thus regeneration is faster with respect to game time if
      the PC is fast or walking around with seven league boots. If a PC
      with low walking energy cost wants to spend the minimum amount of
      game time regenerating, the best bet is to walk around while
      regenerating. The Cursed, Doomed, Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics
      do not make a difference for regeneration purposes. Hunger status
      has no effect on regeneration.</p>

    <p> The modifiers are applied in the order listed here. E.g.
      Trollish Healers with exceptional Toughness get a starting
      regeneration time of 20 / 2 - 1 - 1 = 8.</p>
    <p> RegenRate = Max (2, NaturalRegen *10 if Sick *0.8 if Healthy
      talent *1/0.5/0.125 if wearing C/U/B necklace of rapid healing)
      *10 if wearing rotting armor.</p>
    <p> The Healing skill provides additional chance for regeneration
      every turn: (Healing / (1200 *4.67 if Sick))%. So with 100 Healing
      the chance is 0.83% per turn (0.39% if sick). The Candle birthsign
      provides additional regeneration every 12 turns.</p>
    <p> RegenAmount = 1 + ClassBonus + CandleBonus + RoomBonus.
      ClassBonus is 1 for lvl 6-11 Healers, lvl 32+ Bards, lvl 32+
      Druids in wilderness, 2 for lvl 12+ Healers, 0 otherwise.
      CandleBonus is 1 for Candle borns, 0 otherwise. RoomBonus is 3 if
      in "refreshing" room, 1 if in "herbs and antiseptics" room, 0
      otherwise.</p>
    <p> Separate from these RegenRate and RegenAmount calculations,
      every piece of regenerating equipment (except amulet of rapid
      healing) grants additional 1 HP per turn. The regenerating
      corruption grants additional 1 HP every 5 turns, but 1 scar every
      1000 regenerations (-1 Dx or -1 Ap).</p>
    <p> All HP regeneration is stopped, if the PC is in the "devoid of
      all life" room, or in water without water breathing.</p>

    <h4>0.14.6.3 Potions of troll blood and raw mana <tt>!</tt></h4>
    Natural regeneration can be affected by drinking potions of troll
    blood (for hit points) or potions of raw mana (for power points).
    These potions cannot lower RegenRate below 5 turns or raise it above
    200. Their effectiveness depends on their blessed/uncursed/cursed
    status:

    <p> Bottom line: always bless your potions of troll blood or raw
      mana.</p>
    <p> As can be seen, many blessed potions of troll blood will get you
      more than good Healing skill, but having Healing at 100 is best.
      Likewise, potions of raw mana are nice, but not as important as
      having a high Concentration skill.</p>

    <h4>0.14.6.4 Troll corpses <tt>%</tt></h4>
    There are four types of troll corpses (troll, troll berserker, troll
    chief, troll king). They all yield either of two messages when eaten
    by a non-Troll:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>"Urg! Foul meat! Your blood suddenly courses faster through
        your veins!" </li>
      <li>"Urg! Foul meat!" </li>
    </ol>
    <p> Message a. indicates that natural HP regeneration decreased by
      one<br>
      Message b. indicates that natural HP regeneration did not change</p>
    <p> For Troll PCs, the messages are slightly modified: <a
        name="0e642"></a></p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>"Yum! Your blood suddenly courses faster through your veins!"
      </li>
      <li>"Yum!" </li>
    </ol>
    <p> The behaviour is the same: a. decreases natural HP regeneration,
      b. does not.</p>
    <p> No corpse can reduce the regeneration time below 6. Trying this
      always gives b. message. This differs from potions of troll blood,
      which always result in the "Your blood suddenly curses faster..."
      message, even if the regeneration time is already minimal. Note
      that the lower threshold is 6, unlike the threshold for potions of
      troll blood, which is 5. This means that Trolls, who cannot make
      use of potions of troll blood, cannot lower their regeneration
      time to 5, unlike the other races.</p>
    <p> The probabilities of getting a decrease in regeneration time
      depends only on the B/U/C status of the corpse. Specifically, it
      does not depend on: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>current regeneration time (no difference between the lowest
        eligible value 7 and the unrealistically high value 200) </li>
      <li>PC race (Human vs. Troll) </li>
      <li>cooked/uncooked status </li>
      <li>type of troll corpse (troll, troll berserker, troll chief,
        troll king) </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Results indicate that blessed corpses work in 100% of the cases
      (although, like all corpses, they cannot lower it below 6), and
      uncursed or cursed corpses work in 50% of the cases. There was no
      observable difference between uncursed and cursed corpses: <a
        name="0e644"></a></p>
    <ul>
      <li>94 blessed troll corpses: 94x decrease </li>
      <li>621 uncursed troll corpses: 314x decrease, 307x no decrease </li>
      <li>361 cursed troll corpses: 187x decrease, 174x no decrease </li>
    </ul>
    <p> There was no difference in weight or satiation value of the
      various kinds of troll corpses. All corpses weigh 240s if not
      cooked, irrespective of B/U/C (rotting) status, and 228s (= 5%
      less) if cooked, again irrespective of B/U/C (rotting) status.</p>
    <p> An uncursed corpse yields 500 units of satiation (like a large
      ration). This is doubled if the corpse is cooked (presumably this
      holds for other corpses too, but this needs further verification).
      The resulting value is modified by +25% for blessed corpes and
      -50% for cursed corpses, just like for other food items. So, e.g.
      a blessed cooked troll chief corpse gives 500 * 2 * 1.25 = 1250
      units of satiation.</p>

    <h4>0.14.7 Seven league boots <tt>[</tt></h4>
    Seven league boots can dramatically reduce the time needed to walk
    around in the wilderness, depending on their blessed/uncursed/cursed
    status:
    <p> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>blessed: time needed for walking is divided by 6 </li>
      <li>uncursed: time needed for walking is divided by 3 </li>
      <li>cursed: time needed for walking is multiplied by 2 </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Blessed/uncursed/cursed seven league boots also alter the base
      energy cost for movement outside the wilderness from 1000 to
      500/750/1500, respectively. The Long Stride talent stacks,
      reducing base energy cost further. Seven league boots should be
      blessed immediately. They enable the PC to outrun anything other
      than quicklings. Consequently, some players regard seven league
      boots as the most important item in the game, and will use a wish
      to obtain them, if necessary.</p>

    <h4>0.14.8 Stethoscopes <tt>]</tt></h4>
    <tt>U</tt>sing a stethoscope, you can determine a monster's
    statistics precisely. Furthermore, using a stethoscope, you can
    easily find secret doors: scan a wall block, and if it "sounds
    hollow", it's a secret door. In addition to monsters and secret
    doors, stethoscopes can also be used on closed doors to find out the
    number of monsters behind it. The messages are:

    <h4>0.14.9 Safe places to store items</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Top line of the Terinyo map</b><br>
        The only monster in Terinyo that can step on the top line is the
        sheriff, and he can easily be lured to the first level of the
        Puppy Cave. It is then 100% secure. Skriek can step on the top
        line as well, if one lures him there.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Locked rooms</b><br>
        Locked rooms are one of the safest places to leave items in
        ADOM. With the current state of the monster inventory system
        (they can pick up items but not use them), a monster will never
        be able to unlock a door. Several monsters can smash doors,
        however. Some monsters (balors spring to mind) can teleport into
        locked rooms.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Old Barbarian's glade</b><br>
        The Old Barbarian's glade is a decent place to store items. He
        is the only monster ever generated in this location, so nothing
        randomly generated is going to run away with the PC's stuff. If
        the PC leaves items far away from the Old Barbarian, he will not
        have time to find them prior to the PC's next visit.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Mad Minstrel's clearing</b><br>
        In ADOM 1.0.0, the Mad Minstrel will leave his hut, and will
        pick up items. The safety of the storage is therefore similar to
        the Old Barbarian's glade. No other monsters are generated in
        his clearing, so leaving items far away from the Mad Minstrel
        should not allow him time to find them prior to the PC's next
        visit.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Dwarven Mystic's room in Dwarftown</b><br>
        The ultimate in security, if the PC has not destroyed it with a
        wand of destruction (see section <a href="#3.5.4">3.5.4</a>).
        After <tt>C</tt>hatting wih the Dwarven Mystic, he disappears,
        leaving a 2 x 2 room that cannot be entered except by
        teleportation. Since there are no teleporting monsters found in
        Dwarftown (except for the greater daemon - kill it) this is as
        safe as storage areas get. Other Dwarftown inhabitants can, in
        extremely rare circumstances, be generated in this room. Since
        they will be nonhostile, killing them is not a good idea.
        Teleport them out if possible. Alternatively, use the Ogre Cave
        (see below).
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Ogre Cave in Dwarftown</b><br>
        Monster generation there is nonexistent. So once it is cleared,
        items can be left anywhere on the level with no chance that the
        items will be disturbed.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Secret room in the HMV</b><br>
        Another room accessible only by teleportation, therefore almost
        perfect theoretical security. A monster teleporting into this
        room has never been seen. In extremely rare circumstances,
        however, monsters can be generated in this room. They may well
        be hostile, so killing them is a simple solution. Teleporting
        them out is a worthwhile alternative.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Sharad-Waador's room</b><br>
        Items left in Sharad-Waador's room never seem to be disturbed.
        Sharad-Waador never moves from the square where he is initially
        generated (unless he is attacked or the PC reneges on the deal
        to take the quest), and no time passes on the level between the
        PC's departure and reemergence from the blue dragon caves. This
        is very important, since the player may want to leave important
        non-artifact equipment behind in order to avoid its potential
        destruction in the Blue Dragon Caves (see section <a
          href="#3.19">3.19</a>).

    <h4>0.14.10 Weight and appearance of objects</h4>
    Note the weight of objects. Many valuable objects have a unique
    weight. For instance, there is only one type of sword with a weight
    of 35s, one amulet weighing 7s, one amulet weighing 8s, one girdle
    weighing 30s, etc. In general, lighter items are better. Items with
    odd, unusual or rare weights are often better than their more
    commonly observed counterparts. Certain special items also have a
    unique color. Slaying quarrels will be brown rather than the silver
    of normal quarrels. Metal-shod quarterstaves (whether iron-,
    mithril-, adamantium- or eternium-) are silver; normal quarterstaves
    are brown. This is especially important to remember for
    eternium-shod quarterstaves, since they have the same weight as
    wooden quarterstaves.

    <h4>0.14.11 Dipping stuff into a potion <tt>!</tt></h4>
    The command to dip something into a potion is <tt>!</tt>. The
    various uses of dipping stuff into a potion are compiled below:
    <ul>
      <li>holy water: bless items </li>
      <li>unholy water: curse items </li>
      <li>water: clear scrolls, rust iron items </li>
      <li>poison: poison weapons </li>
      <li>raw chaos: exchange items, see <a href="#0.14.4">0.14.4</a> </li>
      <li>blessed exchange: exchange items, see <a href="#0.14.5">0.14.5</a>
      </li>
      <li>oil: waterproof items (cursed potions work almost 100%,
        uncursed about 50%, blessed almost 0%) </li>
      <li>cursed oil of rust removal: rust items </li>
      <li>uncursed oil of rust removal: remove rust from items </li>
      <li>blessed oil of rust removal: rustproof items </li>
      <li>booze, mana, boost mana: recharge wands, see <a
          href="#0.14.1">0.14.1</a> </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Other potions used for dipping are usualy wasted. The exception
      is when an item containing the essence of Chaos and Corruption is
      dipped into a potion - then the potion is transformed into raw
      chaos. The other exception is Alchemy.</p>
    <p> When dipping a stack of items into a potion, the amount you can
      dip depends on the weight of the item. You can dip:</p>

    <h4>0.14.12 Milking</h4>
    Milking refers to abusing the fact that certain monsters shoot or
    throw some weaponry which cannot be gained by just killing them. In
    cases of one handed weapon there is one weapon per monster limit,
    while missiles can be gained in heaps per single enemy. Both weapons
    and missiles have a base type listed below (it is not possible to
    get arrows/quarrels of -foo- slaying), however, all available
    suffixes/prefixes are available. The best strategy is running along
    a wall of room (with preferably close doors) allowing monster to
    follow. Keeping some space between character and monster is
    recommended but unnecessary. It is better not to do this in
    corridors with low level characters as you can easily end in
    unfavorable position without room to maneuver.
    <p> List of all milkable monsters: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Orc - orcish knife </li>
      <li>Caveman - club </li>
      <li>Dwarven guardian - hand axe </li>
      <li>(Large) gnoll - battle axe </li>
      <li>Orc scorcher, hill orc (sergeant) - orcish spear </li>
      <li>Goblin rockthrower, stone giant (lord), ogre, hill giant
        (chieftain), fire giant (king), troll (berserker/chief/king),
        earth elemental, wall beast - rock </li>
      <li>Greater earth elemental, Ogre Guardian, cyclops - huge rock </li>
      <li>Barbarian (leader), kobold, raider (lord) - arrow </li>
      <li>Hawkslayer - eternium arrow </li>
      <li>Ratling archer - quarrel </li>
      <li>Black hurthling, dark elven archer, pixie archer, quickling
        lord, quickling king - tiny quarrel </li>
      <li>(Greater) titan - eternium quarrel </li>
      <li>Keethrax - sling bullet </li>
    </ul>
    Note that barbarian encounters in wilderness can practically net a
    large amount of arrows (including prefixed ammo) in short time.
    Arrow and spear traps can also provide ammunition if triggered
    multiple time by monsters or by PC with <tt>Ctrl-t</tt> command.
    Triggering traps on yourself will always lead to a successful hit,
    however, with sufficient protection (in terms of PV) damage to PC
    may be nullified. Note that spear traps always produce base iron
    spears without any prefixes/suffixes.
    <p> Though not milking in the strictest sense of the term, giant ant
      workers and other digging monsters can be similarly milked for
      rocks by allowing them to dig out large sections of a dungeon
      level. Casting Earthquake is another way of getting large amounts
      of rocks.</p>

    <h4>0.14.13 Losing cursed stuff</h4>
    Careful reader shall already know about the many ways of losing
    cursed stuff. For completeness, here we list all of them. Note that
    for trapped armor morphing and destroying are the only ways to get
    rid of it.
    <p> <b>Removing curse</b> </p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>r</tt>ead non-cursed scroll of uncursing. </li>
      <li><tt>!</tt> dip them item into potion of holy water. You can
        get holy water by dropping water on coaligned altar if your
        piety is high enough, or by dipping normal or unholy water into
        holy water. </li>
      <li><tt>_</tt> pray, your piety must be at least 50 (pleased and
        up). </li>
      <li><tt>Z</tt> cast the Remove Curse spell. Note that a wand or
        potion of wonder may grant you the spell. </li>
      <li><tt>Ctrl-x</tt> Wizard's level 40 class power allows to
        uncurse an item. </li>
      <li><tt>r</tt>ead cursed scroll of repair to broke your cursed
        item, then read blessed scroll of repair to both repair and
        uncurse it. This tactic can also be exploited to uncurse or
        bless large stacks of items. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <b>Unequipping the item</b> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If your cursed item is a weapon, you can fight a monster with
        disarm ability. These are: ratling
        fencer/duelist/warrior/warlord, (master) swordsman, bunny master
        (Bugs), Mad Minstrel. </li>
      <li>For helmets, Kranf Niest will remove any helmet from the PC as
        a part of getting the Healing skill. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <b>Morphing</b></p>
    <p> <tt>!</tt> dipping items into a potion of raw chaos or blessed
      potion of exchange will change the item into another of its type,
      removing it from your body. Keep in mind that if you are using raw
      chaos potions you have a risk of explosion, which does 10d30
      damage and corrupts heavily (100d100 CP's).</p>
    <p> <b>Destroying</b> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Scroll of item destruction works only if there are at least 4
        items equipped, granting only 25% chance to lose your cursed
        item. </li>
      <li>Annihilators and eyes of destruction can destroy equipped
        items, regardless of material. </li>
      <li>Angering your deity (usually just by praying repeatedly) will
        eventually result it "Your equipment turns to dust." destroying
        all cursed equipped items (remove other items). </li>
      <li>For iron items only, (large/giant) rust monsters are usable -
        just stand next to them. </li>
      <li>If your cursed item is a weapon made of iron, mithril or
        adamantium, attacking ochre jellies or gray oozes can damage it
        to the point of destruction. Similarly, you can get rid of
        cursed gloves or boots by fighting these unarmed or kicking
        them, respectively. </li>
      <li>Acid or fireball trap can be set off <tt>Ctrl-t</tt> to
        intentionaly destroy equipped item, however only items
        destructible by acid or fire respectively - see the item
        destruction table below. Bad Luck helps here. The table is
        useful for the remaining methods as well. </li>
      <li>For items destructible by fire, visit ToEF - however as this
        is dangerous for all items, bringing blessed fireproof blanket
        is recommended. </li>
      <li>Monsters with breath attacks can destroy equipped items. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.14.14"></a></p>
    <h4>0.14.14 Item destruction</h4>
    Item destruction has two parameters, the elemental type, and the
    maximum number of items to destroy. There are 7 elements which can
    cause item destruction or damage (max number of items in
    parenthesis):
    <ul>
      <li>fire: ToEF (2 every turn), exploding spellbook (1000), failed
        Alchemy (Min(1,dmg/5)), fireball trap, fire vortex, red dragons
      </li>
      <li>ice: D:49, ice vortex, white dragons </li>
      <li>acid: acid trap (Min(1,dmg/5)), acid vortex, black dragons </li>
      <li>lightning: Air Temple (Min(1,dmg/5)), lightning vortex, blue
        dragons </li>
      <li>water: water trap (1000), pool (1000), rain (1), Swimming (50%
        chance, 1000 items), water orb insertion on D:48, water
        elementals/grues/dragons </li>
      <li>crushing: falling Rift (40), ceiling door trap (DL), pit
        traps, failed mountaineering (Min(1,dmg/5)) </li>
      <li>ripping: exploding rune door trap </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Equipped rings of ice or fire have chance of negating equipment
      fire or ice damage, respectively. The RingBonus is 98/80/50 B/U/C
      for each equipped ring. All damage is negated if Min(99,
      RingBonus+Luck) &lt;= 1d100. Fireproof/waterproof blankets protect
      inventory (not equipment) 100% against fire/water damage
      respecively, regardless of B/U/C status. Fireproof blanket is
      destroyed if 5/15/100 B/U/C + (GoodLuck-BadLuck) * 10 &gt;=1d1000.
      Always the best blanket is selected if there are multiple. Note
      that in this case BadLuck actually increases fireproof blanket
      longevity (probably bug). Waterproof blankets are not destroyed in
      this manner.</p>
    <p> For fire, ice, acid and lightning elemental damage being
      resistant decreases chances of item damage. The Divisor starts at
      1; there is +2 if you are intrinsically resistant, +3 if you are
      intrinsically immune, +1 per equipped item granting resistance,
      and +3 per equipped item granting immunity. Note this is different
      from resistance to HP damage.</p>
    <p> Items which are not immune (0% in the below table) have a base
      chance of destruction or damage depending only on the item's
      material and the element in question. This chance is reduced by
      20% (rounding down) if the item is blessed. It is then increased
      by 50% if the item is rusty and twice your Luck is subtracted.
      Finally, the chance is divided by the Divisor above.</p>

    <p> Some other facts regarding item destruction: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If a stack of items is targeted, the number of actually
        damaged/destroyed items is 1dNumberOfItemsInStack. </li>
      <li>Any item/element combination value of 1% is completely safe if
        the item is blessed and the PC does not have negative Luck. </li>
      <li>Thick gauntlets automatically resist damage 75% of the time. </li>
      <li>Artifacts cannot be damaged. </li>
      <li>Any item grating resistance can't be damaged by the
        corresponding element. This is not true for items granting
        immunity. </li>
      <li>Always half of items in inventory are safe from damage. This
        changes as items are picked or dropped, or the inventory is
        viewed. </li>
      <li>Equipment items are considered for damage, starting from the
        bottom and working up; tools are the first to take a hit and the
        helmet is the last. </li>
      <li>Body armor cannot be damaged during wearing or removing. </li>
      <li>Rings under gauntlets can't be damaged; however gauntlets may
        get destroyed first leaving rings vulnerable. </li>
      <li>No items can be damaged during a long interruptible action,
        such as reading a book. </li>
      <li>Rustproofed and naturally rustproof items cannot be affected
        by water. </li>
      <li>The room effect "scarred by many fights" triples chance of
        item destruction. </li>
      <li>Items made of glass are 100% destroyed if kicked. </li>

    <h3>0.15 Miscellaneous</h3>
    <a name="0.15.1"></a>
    <h4>0.15.1 Dungeon generation</h4>
    Thanks to gut for the following observations.
    <p> Dungeon generation has a few peculiarities that may be worth
      mentioning. Almost all rooms generated on any level will have an
      odd number of floor spaces available. To my knowledge, the only
      exception to this is the very rare random shop room. They are
      capable of being generated with an even number of available floor
      spaces, and this causes the 'dig' algorithm in the game to be
      unable to connect them to the rest of the map. The only way to
      reach these shops is by tunneling.</p>
    <p> Remarks about staircase generation and room layout:</p>
    <p> When hopping in the ID, I noticed that some rooms were likely to
      have staircases in the adjacent room. Basically, if you enter a
      room that's <i>in</i> a corner, or <i>near</i> a corner, and
      your room has a door that leads <i>directly</i> up, down, left or
      right, into a corner, there is likely a stair room there.</p>
    <p> For example, if a room like this:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <pre>   #########
   #.......#
   #.&lt;.....#
   #.......#
   #####.###
       #+#
</pre>
    is generated at the top of the level, at the left or right-hand
    corners, it likely leads to a stair room.
    <p> Please note that this:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <pre>   #########
   #.......#
   #.&lt;.....###
   #.........#
   #########.#
           #.#
           #.#
           ..#
</pre>
    isn't the same, and will not work.
    <p> One like this:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <pre>      #+#
   ####.####
   #.......#
   #.&lt;.....#
   #.......#
   #########
</pre>
    at the bottom left or right-hand corners is good too.
    <p> A room like this:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <pre> #######
 #.....##
 #.&lt;....+
 #.....##
 #######
</pre>
    has a high probability if it is generated at the right-hand side of
    the map, but it has to be at the very top or bottom, right next to a
    corner.
    <p> The same goes for a room like this:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <pre> #######
##.....#
+....&lt;.#
##.....#
 #######
</pre>
    in the left hand side of the level.
    <p> A room like this :</p>
    <p> </p>
    <pre> #######
##.....###
.....&lt;....
##.....###
 #######
</pre>
    is also good if next to any corner, but doesn't seem as sure as the
    others.

    <h4>0.15.2 Kicking <tt>k</tt></h4>
    You ought to know that you can <tt>k</tt>ick various things around.
    Pressing <tt>K</tt> will reveal your kick damage.
    <p> <b>General</b></p>
    <p> KickBonus is normally 0. Strong Legs talent gives +15, Monks get
      +Level*2. Kicking is not possible while in a pit or webs or the
      wilderness. Kicking while confused, stunned, or blind requires a
      Attribute in attribute+40 check; attribute is Dexterity for
      blindness and Willpower for Confused and Stunned state.</p>
    <p> <b>Doors <tt>+</tt></b></p>
    <p> Kicking a door will succeed St + KickBonus times in St + 12 (112
      if the door is secret). Successfully kicking doors will cause
      tension rooms to crumble, will always trigger traps, and trains
      St. There is a 20% chance that 1d2 sticks will be created.
      Unsuccessfully kicking a door has a 14-St chance in 15 of training
      St. If the door is trapped, you have a (Ma + 1) in 30 chance of
      NOT triggering it. If you avoid the trap, you will train Mana.
      Failing to kick open an undiscovered secret door is treated as
      kicking an undiggable wall. If a secret door is kicked open and
      discovered at the same instant, it has a 10% chance of being
      trapped.</p>
    <p> <b>Walls <tt>#</tt></b></p>
    <p> Level 13+ Monks can kick down walls on a straight Strength in
      100 roll. Non-Monks kicking walls will take 1dN damage, N = Max(2,
      St/3). Add 2 to N if the wall is non-diggable.</p>
    <p> <a name="0.15.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.15.3 Undocumented character abilities</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>All characters gain to-hit and to-damage bonuses when fighting
        as a true berserker, which means no armor can be worn and
        Tactics must be set to berserk. Shields are acceptable, any worn
        armor is not. Level 40 and higher Barbarians get additional
        bonuses on top of this when fighting as a true berserker. Note
        that Monks do not seem to receive this true berserker bonus. </li>
      <li>Monks gain the ability to kick down walls at experience level
        13. </li>
      <li>Merchants always specialize in a certain item: potions, rings,
        scrolls, or wands. This specialization allows them to identify
        any item in that category on sight. </li>
      <li>Merchants get additional bonuses to throwing coins (+level to
        hit, +level/2+3 to damage). Dopplegangers cannot deflect a
        merchant's thrown coins. The coin throw action costs 1200 energy
        points as opposed to the normal 1000. Getting the Quick Shot
        talent does apply to the coin throw attack, bringing it to 1080.
        The coin throw attack is not capable of receiving weapon marks,
        nor does it benefit from the Strong Thrower talent. The Archery
        skill is not trained by coin throwing. Coin throwing does
        benefit from a high Dexterity attribute, rings of slaying,
        archery gloves, the Good Shot talent, the Keen Shot talent, the
        Quick Shot talent, the Missile Weapon Master talent, and the
        Find Weakness skill. Coin throw attacks start out with a range
        of only 3, but at exp. level 10, it increases to 5, and
        increases a further +2 with each 10 experience levels gained. </li>
      <li>Healers have the ability to use a stethoscope without
        consuming any game time. All other classes consume one turn of
        game time when using a stethoscope. </li>
      <li>Archers have a unique ability to dodge missiles. When a
        missile misses any other class PC, it simply stops at the PC's
        square. Missiles often fly past Archers. This is actually
        probably undesirable since Archers want to pick up those
        missiles, but it is nevertheless an undocumented unique ability.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>0.15.4 Smithing</h4>
    Taken from <a href="http://www.adomgb.info/adomfaq.html">Official
      ADOM FAQ</a>:
    <p> Smithing is a complicated task. You need the following
      ingredients: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Any kind of hammer <tt>(</tt>. </li>
      <li>An anvil <tt>]</tt>. There are two guaranteed in the game
        (kill Kherab and Glod), but they also rarely appear in dungeons.
      </li>
      <li>Something to smith! You need to know what kind of metal it's
        made of (use Metallurgy). </li>
      <li>An ingot of the appropriate metal <tt>]</tt>. A lump of ore
        won't cut it, but can be converted into ingots by applying the
        Smithing skill to it first. Generate some lumps by Mining. </li>
      <li>A forge <tt>&amp;</tt>. You can't carry these around with
        you, but you can hope to find one in your travels. There are two
        locations in the game where forges are guaranteed (Dwarftown and
        Darkforge), and there can be additional forges at random
        locations. </li>
    </ol>
    Stand on the forge, wield the hammer, and <tt>a</tt>pply your
    Smithing skill to your metal item. This will also serve to make
    metal ingots out of ore lumps. It's rumored that wearing a leather
    apron helps in some mysterious way.
    <p> Other useful facts regarding Smithing: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An easy way to train Smithing is by removing rust. Low risk of
        damaging the item, no lost ingots, and easy to get rusty items
        with a river or a water trap. Also quite fast. </li>
      <li>Glod charges exactly 2500gp in all cases, and only if he is on
        the current level, for the use of his forge. Killing him, luring
        him off the level, and turning him into a writhing mass of
        primal chaos will all stop the demands; making him hostile
        won't. </li>
      <li>The Smithing skill costs a base 5000gp from Glod, 5250 if
        female. If you have very high Charisma, you get a discount; 1%
        per 1 Ch over 15. Being cursed doubles the price, doomed triple,
        being Troll doubles, being Orc quadruples, all cumulative. </li>
      <li>You need a hammer wielded in either hand and an anvil in
        inventory and equipment to smith. If multiple such items apply,
        the best by B/U/C is used. The following items count as hammers:
        large eternium hammer, large mithril hammer, large adamantium
        hammer, huge iron hammer, eternium warhammer, warhammer,
        adamantium warhammer, mithril warhammer, hammer of the gods,
        large hammer. </li>
      <li>You can do three things with a smithing setup - smelt ore,
        remove rust, and improve items. </li>
      <li>Teleportitis does not occur during smithing sessions. </li>
      <li>Smithing is influenced by the statuses of all involved items
        (hammer, anvil, worked item, and ingot if applicable). BUCMod in
        the below formulas means +10 per cursed item and -10 per blessed
        item. </li>
      <li>You can never smith artifacts. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.15.4.1"></a></p>
    <h4>0.15.4.1 Smelting ore</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Takes 25 turns (even for Weaponsmiths). If you are
        interrupted, the ore is lost. </li>
      <li>Let Difficulty = BUCMod + 0/-5/-10/-20 by ore material
        (iron/mithril/adamantium/eternium - better materials are
        easier). </li>
      <li>If Smithing &gt;= 1d(110+Difficulty), you now have an ingot
        (10/80/10 B/U/C and 2% chance of rusty if iron) instead of the
        ore. </li>
      <li>Otherwise, you fail. Normally you keep the ore. There is a
        Difficulty+1 in Smithing*4 chance of losing the ore. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.15.4.2"></a></p>
    <h4>0.15.4.2 Removing rust</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Takes 25 turns, or 6 for level 12+ Weaponsmiths. Being
        interrupted has no lasting effects. </li>
      <li>If Smithing &gt;= 1d(110+BUCMod), you remove the rust. </li>
      <li>Otherwise, nothing happens. There is a BUCMod+1 in Smithing*4
        chance of the item becoming broken. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="0.15.4.3"></a></p>
    <h4>0.15.4.3 Improving items</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Requires an ingot of the same material as the work item, which
        is consumed in the process. </li>
      <li>Requires (200 - Smithing) turns (one-quarter that for level
        12+ Weaponsmiths). Being interrupted has no lasting effects and
        does not consume an ingot. </li>
      <li>If the item is broken, you will attempt to fix it. Succeed if
        120 + BUCMod &lt; Smithing. No penalty on failure. </li>
      <li>Otherwise, you attempt to increase the item's stats. This is a
        two-step process; first you must pass a Smithing check to
        improve the item at all, then the amount by which the item is
        improved is determined. Improvement amounts are determined only
        by the item's existing stats, not by skill. If you fail the
        Smithing check, "You fail to improve the -item-". If you pass it
        but zero improvement is rolled, "Despite your best efforts the
        quality of the -item- does not improve.". Otherwise, "You manage
        to improve the -item-.". </li>
      <li>The difficulty of the check is determined as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Start with Difficulty equal to BUCMod. </li>
          <li>If the item is a weapon, add 12 times the sum of the
            absolute values of the to-hit and to-damage numbers (X and Y
            in (+X, 1d4+Y)). </li>
          <li>Otherwise, add 18 times the sum of the absolute values of
            the DV and PV numbers. </li>
          <li>If you are a Weaponsmith of any level and Difficulty is
            positive, divide it by 2. Otherwise, add 20. </li>
          <li>Subtract your experience level. </li>
          <li>Final Difficulty is 120 + Difficulty, with a minimum of
            120. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Supposing you pass the test (Smithing &gt;= 1dDifficulty), the
        amounts and types of increase depend on the item's class. </li>
      <li>For melee and missile weapons:
        <ul>
          <li>Increase to-hit by 1d4 if to-hit is less than 9 and one
            chance in the (absolute value of to-hit or 2, whichever is
            larger). </li>
          <li>Increase to-damage by 1d4 if to-damage is less than 9 and
            one chance in the (absolute value of to-damage or 2,
            whichever is larger), and to-hit was not increased. </li>
          <li>For melee weapons only, increase the DV modifier by 1 if
            it is no more than 3 more than the base DV modifier of the
            weapon type, and neither to-hit nor to-damage were
            increased. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>For helmets, armor, girdles, shields, bracers, gauntlets, and
        boots:
        <ul>
          <li>Increase DV by 1d3 if it is less than 6 more than the base
            value OR on a one-in-(3 + 2*abs(DV)) chance. </li>
          <li>Increase PV by 1d3 if it is less than 4 more than the base
            value OR on a one-in-(3 + 2*abs(PV)) chance, and DV was not
            increased. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>All other item types cannot be improved. </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>0.15.5 Darkness</h4>
    Creating darkness:
    <ul>
      <li>Darkness spell </li>
      <li>crystal of darkness </li>
      <li>scroll of darkness </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Removing darkness: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Light spell </li>
      <li>wand of light </li>
      <li>crystal of light </li>
      <li>scroll of light (note that while it is impossible to read a
        scroll while in darkness, you can read a scroll of light while
        standing next to a dark area) </li>
      <li>the artifact potion Phial of Caladriel </li>
      <li>torch - temporary </li>
      <li>prayer </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Thanks to gut for the following section.</p>
    <p> Darkness is one of the most useful options available to all
      literate PCs, yet it's one of the most underused. I can't count
      the number of players that say that they never even bothered with
      trying it.</p>
    <p> Monsters that can't see in Darkness will allow the PC to pound
      them to death without retaliation. The only exception is for
      monsters that are capable of panic. These monsters will be able to
      hit the PC when in a state of panic, but <i>only</i> if they do
      not have an escape route. For this reason, it's best to avoid
      using Darkness in a narrow corridor, because stray monsters can
      easily cut off the escape path of a powerful monster that is
      capable of killing the PC with one hit.</p>
    <p> No giant can see in Darkness, most humanoids also can't, with
      the notable exceptions of trolls, orcs, minotaurs, and dark elves.
      This is especially important to remember against tough monsters
      such as ogre magi (yes even the arena champion kind). Vortices,
      mimics and several other early-game PC killers are all helpless in
      Darkness and vortices aren't even capable of panic.</p>
    <p> There is a bug in the game that keeps Darkness from working
      properly on door squares. It is important to mention that the PC
      is perfectly safe to use Darkness if the <i>PC</i> is on the door
      square, but not if the monster is on the door square.</p>
    <p> Other monsters that are known to see in Darkness (thanks mike):</p>
    <p> All orcs, all dark elves, all minotaurs, all undead, all red
      dragons, great blue wyrm, stone golem, stone grue, stone snake,
      earth elemental, greater earth elemental, living wall, wall beast,
      diamond golem, eternium golem, steel golem, steel horror, carrion
      crawler, chaos brother, WMoPC, master assassin, fire demon,
      quickling king, quickling queen, greater claw bug, killer bug,
      least daemon, lesser daemon, greater daemon, jackal demon, black
      unicorn.</p>

    <h4>0.15.7.3 Bugs used to get unfair advantage</h4>
    Taking advantage of (or abusing) bugs in this category is generally
    frowned upon. At least, you should mention which bugs you took
    advantage of when posting YAVP.
    <p> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>naming the unseen - the <tt>n</tt>ame command can be used to
        detect invisible monsters, even without the See Invisible
        intrinsic </li>
      <li>piety overflow - pissing a god too much causes the piety to
        wrap around to very high positive value, allowing for many
        crownings </li>
      <li>dragons can pick up gold which is then effectively doubled
        when they are killed; see <a href="#0.9.4.4">0.9.4.4</a>
      </li>
      <li>the Monk's circular kick ability, as well as Fighter's all
        round attack, have issues when non-hostiles are near; it will
        ask if you're sure you want to kick or attack them, and you
        select no - your kick/attack still hits the other monsters, but
        no time passes </li>
      <li>using fast pickup command <tt>;</tt> while standing on a pile
        of items, then canceling it (<tt>q</tt>), causes the number of
        elapsed game turns to decrease; this can be used to get
        ludicrous bonus to high score </li>
      <li>starting to walk against a wall wastes one turn without the PC
        moving; this can be abused to get free HP and PP regeneration
        without monsters being allowed to act </li>
      <li>the Good Learner talent grants 40% more xp, instead of the
        stated 2% </li>
      <li>kick robbing - items can be kicked out of shop if a corner
        wall is destroyed - the game doesn't consider this technique
        robbing at all </li>
      <li>Casino gambling happens in one turn, the PC doesn't get the
        corruption it should; and winnings are virtually guaranteed </li>
      <li>blessing undead while invisible will not make them aware of
        your presence, and you can kill them without them fighting back;
        works also with bolt spells and Drakeling's acid spit; same for
        monsters who don't see in darkness; unless panicked, they just
        stay in place and take damage </li>
      <li>attribute training from herbs/corpses/Garth is based on
        modified attributes instead of base attributes; this leads to
        abuse of sickness and starvation to pump attributes
        unrealistically high </li>
      <li>Necromancers lvl50 using +To equipment can return to life
        indefinitely </li>
      <li>look command detects webs outside visibility if level has been
        explored before </li>
      <li>wish engines - a way to get unlimited wishes
        <ol>
          <li>gather a stack of 19 rings, and a handful of potions of
            exchange </li>
          <li>bless the potions and dip the rings into them at DL 8 to
            have best chance for generating rings of djinni summoning;
            since 19 rings can be dipped at once, a lucky PC can end up
            with 19 wishes from this alone </li>
          <li>the probability of getting a ring of djinni summoning is
            about 5%; if you wish for potions of exchange, you get an
            average of 3, so converting all wishes into potions (minus a
            few water) gives ~57 PoEX; the odds of being able to get
            more RoDS is pretty high at this point </li>

    <h4>0.15.7.4 Other bugs</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>berserking - monster can sometimes panic and attack themselves
      </li>
      <li>half of the artifacts are only available as crowning gifts,
        and can never be generated randomly </li>
      <li>the rate of corruption increases at the 90-day mark, but
        doesn't again at the 180 and 270 day marks as it's supposed to </li>
      <li>Unicorn birthsign increases how quickly alignment changes
        towards chaotic instead of decreasing it </li>
      <li>it is possible for experience gains to overflow; the most
        common example would probably be killing too many cats results
        in the Cat Lord giving only 1 xp, but there are other
        possibilities as well </li>
      <li>+Crit armor does not improve critical hits rate </li>
      <li>killing something using PoCC doesn't yield any xp </li>
      <li>Elementalists don't get fire resistance at level 6, but they
        should </li>
      <li>the formula for potential attribute gains (e.g. from corpses)
        is bugged; it's 100% likely at 28 -attribute-, but 55% at 22
        (and is odd in between) </li>
      <li>cursed scrolls of repair will "break" normally unbreakable
        equipment, like herbs and potions </li>
      <li>PCs with high Swimming skill use more energy to move while in
        water than PCs without Swimming </li>
      <li>darkness does not work on door squares </li>
      <li>fireproof blankets work better with BadLuck (see also <a
          href="#0ee">0.14.14</a>) </li>
      <li>invisible monsters yield double xp even when the PC has +SeeI
      </li>
      <li>door traps set off by monsters will attribute kills to the PC
      </li>
      <li>bats do see in the dark, but don't see invisible </li>
      <li>covered pit bug - If a PC digs a hole, and proceeds to cover
        the hole with a plain blanket, instead of a covered pit trap
        appearing, the trap will magically transform into whatever kind
        of trap is appropriate for that square </li>
      <li>entering 0 when using the Wizard's <tt>r</tt>echarge wands
        ability causes the wand to disappear without any further effect
        or message; just hitting Enter causes overcharge </li>
      <li>blind PCs cannot insert orbs into anomalies on D:48 </li>
      <li>pissing off the Balance god via reading tract of order/chaos
        is incorrectly displayed as pissing off the Order god </li>
      <li>while staying on top of a pit, one can repeatedly activate the
        trap to repeatedly fall into the pit, without having to climb
        out </li>
      <li>aquatic beings can be tamed and then taken for a walk on the
        mountains </li>
      <li>raised corpses slowly decompose until they crumble - however
        if they are out of sight they do not die and have a negative
        amount of hitpoints </li>
      <li>if wearing a ring of teleport control and have +TCtr
        intrinsic, you can lose the ability to control teleportation by
        drinking from pool, despite wearing the ring (unconfirmed) </li>
      <li>room effects don't take darkness/invisibility into account </li>
      <li>to avoid a falling door trap, the PC jumps back on the square
        that he came from; if this is blocked, the PC won't jump
        anywhere, despite there might be another vacant square </li>
      <li>gold has hidden B/U/C status: if you have 19 or less gold
        pieces, you can dip the entire stack into a potion of unholy
        water; then wield 1 gp in either hand - the gold piece cannot be
        removed; this does not work when you have more gold - the stack
        will remain uncursed; similarly, angry deity can curse wielded
        gold </li>

        They find every spellbook available in the game. </li>

      <li>They say that monsters tamed by bards will never willingly
        leave. - True. </li>
      <li>They say that monuments can hold dark secrets. - This probably
        refers to the Infinite Dungeon, which was once a monument to
        Law. Chaos has transformed it into its current condition, and it
        holds a dark secret, the location of the Sceptre of Chaos (as
        well as Filk, but this message probably predates Filk). Might
        also refer to the Stone Circle, where the Crown of Chaos is
        located. </li>

        than once. - The Banshee's wail instakills, if the PC is not

      <li>They say that potions of toughness tend to remove your hungry
        feelings. - True. </li>
      <li>They say that praying at altars of your deity is helpful. -
        No, <i>sacrificing</i> at coaligned altars is helpful. </li>
      <li>They say that quests are noble and just. - Not all of them. </li>
      <li>They say that repetitive requests are frowned upon by the
        gods. - Praying too often will result in an angry deity. </li>
      <li>They say that rubbing moss of mareilon onto your skin might
        get you moving. - It increases Dexterity. </li>
      <li>They say that sacrifices can be dangerous. - Especially live
        ones on a noncoaligned altar. </li>
      <li>They say that shopkeepers base their prices upon racial
        preferences. - True. Waldenbrook hates Dark Elves and Orcs, for
        example. </li>

        - True. </li>
      <li>They say that shops are dangerous at night. - Shopkeepers
        don't see the PC pick up items in the dark, but the PC still
        must pay. </li>
      <li>They say that Sis might enhance your creativity. - By making
        the PC think of uses for them. </li>

        them. </li>

        special moments. - Some items give nice resistances and
        abilities not often needed. </li>
      <li>They say that some statues have magical bones. - Statues may
        yield wands when broken by kicking. </li>
      <li>They say that some stuff needs a lot of blessing to improve. -
        One blessing (of seven league boots, rings of djinni summoning,
        potions of gain attributes, rings of the fish) is enough. </li>
      <li>They say that some wands are not very reliable. - True - rusty
        wands of ball lightning, for instance. </li>

        confuses. </li>
      <li>They say that the home of the banshee is ruled by eternal
        decay. - Actually, corpses never rot there. </li>

        lightning or wands of far slaying. </li>

    <h4>0.15.9 Final score</h4>
    The algorithm presented here is revised to reflect experiments
    conducted in April, 2008:
    <pre>score = sum of all skill scores / 20 +
    spell memory [the first number] for each known spell / 5 + 50 +
    MIN(piety - 200, 10000000) +
    (level - 1) * 50 +
    experience / ~3.5 +
    (sum of the danger ratings [1-50] of explored levels) * 30 +
    (# identified items * 100) +
    various amounts for having intrinsics (between 200 and 10000 each) +
    ~2000 (retrieving the cute puppy) +
    20000 (making Blup happy) +
    (sum of attribute modifications * 200) +
    (# of successful dwarven quests * 5000) +
    5000 (if member of thieves guild) +
    5000 (if head of thieves guild) +
    1000 (adhering to the principles of the Cat Lord)
    250000 (saving Khelavaster) +
    2000000 (being a paragon of order) +
    MAX(0, 300 - max. hitpoints) * 1000 (only if the game was completed) +
    20000 (no divine interventions and game complete) +
    20000 (champion) +
    -10000 (fallen champion) +
    -(chaos score * 20) (typical about 1000 points score per corruption)
</pre>
    This score is doubled if you managed to solve the major goal of the
    game. If you managed to solve the game and leave the Drakalor Chain
    the following is added to that score:
    <p> MAX(0, 80000 - moves) * 1000</p>
    <p> Then the score is once more doubled.</p>

    <p> The wilderness is the overland map of the Drakalor Chain - you
      start the game in the upper right corner of the wilderness, and
      you may enter a wilderness location immediately by pressing <tt>&gt;</tt>.
      It may be useful to learn spells, equip starting items etc. When
      no monsters are around, a wilderness location may be left with <tt>&lt;</tt>.</p>
    <p> The wilderness is often regarded as a curse by new players,
      whose PCs are killed in wilderness encounters and have difficulty
      keeping their PCs fed during treks across the wilderness. Advanced
      players with PCs who are well equipped to deal with the wilderness
      regard it as a wonderful resource.</p>
    <p> The Survival skill can be useful for lengthy stays in the
      wilderness, but note that applying it wastes a lot of game time.</p>

    <p> <a name="1.1.1"></a></p>
    <h4>1.1.1 Why start the game in the wilderness?</h4>
    Many players will start the game in the wilderness, at least for the
    first kill, because the first monster killed can be controlled
    according to what type of wilderness square generates an encounter.
    <p> <a name="1.1.2"></a></p>
    <h4>1.1.2 Strategy and problems in the wilderness</h4>
    In order to avoid wasting too much time in the wilderness (e.g.
    because of the dreadful 90 day limit), it is good to know how long
    it actually takes to do things in the wilderness.
    <p> All times are approximate since there are slight variations of
      some minutes. It is also the case that without apparent reason
      walking times are sometimes doubled. This can happen for any
      terrain type and might be a bug. Being burdened or strained does
      not cause this and has marginal, if any, effect on movement time
      in the wilderness.</p>

    <p> Note that the Swimming skill and water breathing intrinsic have
      no effect on the time needed to move onto a water square.
      Likewise, the Climbing skill and the blessed/uncursed/cursed
      status of a climbing set have no effect on the time needed to move
      onto a mountain square.</p>
    <p> Note that a climbing set is required to move onto mountains. It
      is important to know the status of a climbing set, in particular
      making sure it is not cursed. A cursed climbing set will fail at
      the most inopportune moment. At a minimum, the resulting slip
      while mountaineering will cause extensive equipment destruction.
      It is often fatal. The blessed vs uncursed status seems to have
      little or no effect.</p>
    <p> <a name="1.1.3"></a></p>
    <h4>1.1.3 Survival skill</h4>
    Successfully applying the Survival skill when not bloated increases
    the satiation value of the PC by about 100 (equivalent to 1/5 large
    ration, see <a href="#Appendix_G">Appendix G</a>). This is roughly tripled
    for Rangers of level 6 or above. These values hold for both water
    and land squares.
    <p> If the PC is already bloated, his satiation value isn't
      increased. Instead, he gathers plant seeds (on land squares) or
      goes fishing (on water squares). The amount of seeds gathered does
      not depend on terrain type or skill value and averages at about
      5.2. Rangers of level 6 or above receive triple amount.</p>
    <p> When fishing is successful, the PC obtains exactly one piece of
      fish meat.</p>
    <p> The chances of success when applying the Survival skill depend
      on skill value, terrain type, the Ranger level 6 class power, and
      the Falcon birthsign. The Falcon birthsign gives a 1/3 chance of
      success even if you fail the initial check. The following success
      rates were measured by applying the Survival skill 100 times, with
      a skill value of 100. The "normal" column applies to non-Rangers
      and Rangers of level 1-5, the "high" column to Rangers of level
      6-50. Level is the terrain difficulty level.</p>

    <p> [1] if the Kranach quest is received, PC is max level 5, has max
      5000 xp, there is 25% chance of an encounter being a group of
      roving raiders</p>
    <p> <a name="1.1.4.1"></a></p>
    <h4>1.1.4.1 Chance for ambush</h4>
    After the encounter is generated, 3 possible situations may occur:
    <ol>
      <li>you are ambushed </li>
      <li>you are given choices of <tt>a</tt>mbush, <tt>e</tt>vade, <tt>f</tt>ight
      </li>
      <li>your choices are only <tt>e</tt>vade or <tt>f</tt>ight </li>
    </ol>
    <p> Case 1 cannot happen to invisible PCs, lvl 6+ Druids and lvl 25+
      Merchants. For others, there is 3.3% chance to get ambushed, then
      another 6.7% chance for cursed PCs, then another 12.5% chance for
      doomed PCs. This gives about 21% chance if the PC is both cursed
      and doomed. However, you still avoid ambush if Pe&gt;1d100, or if
      Alertness&gt;1d150, or if you have the Scout talent and 10%.</p>
    <p> Case 2 will happen if not case 1 and if Stealth+Survival+X &gt;
      1d1000, where X = 500 - Level*10 if invisible (yes, being high
      level is worse here), X = 0 otherwise.</p>
    <p> Otherwise case 3.</p>
    <p> <a name="1.1.4.2"></a></p>
    <h4>1.1.4.2 Chance to evade</h4>
    Lvl 6+ Druids and Lvl 25+ Rangers evade automatically. Others must
    pass at least one of the following four checks:
    <ol>
      <li>Evade chance for an encounter type as in the above table. This
        chance is tripled if you had a choice of ambush </li>
      <li>Evade2 chance for invisible PCs only </li>
      <li>Stealth &gt; 1d(200 - Min(Evade,Evade2)) </li>
      <li>you have the Scout talent and 33% </li>
    </ol>

    Terinyo is a small hamlet, commonly the first place new players will
    visit in their adventure. It is strongly advised that you do not
    attack any of the residents of Terinyo, as this WILL lead to your
    death unless you know exactly what you are doing.
    <br>
    <a name="1.2.1"></a>
    <h4>1.2.1 Tywat Pare, the sheriff <tt>t</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 25, PV: 3, Hits: 88, Attacks: 2, Damage: 1d8+8, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Tywat Pare is source of two quests. The first is to find and kill
    Kranach, a raider lord terrorizing the countryside. The rewards for
    this quest are a lawful boost to alignment and 3000 gold pieces.
    Note that the lawful boost is greater if a magnanimous PC leaves the
    3000 gold pieces on the ground where Tywat Pare drops them.
    <p> The second quest is available once the PC reaches experience
      level ten. The quest objective is to kill the crime lord
      Hotzenplotz, who can be found in the outlaw village Lawenilothehl
      near Terinyo. Note that attacking Hotzenplotz while he is
      nonhostile is a chaotic act. However, the lawful boost received
      when Tywat Pare is informed of the success of the mission more
      than offsets this. As a reward for this quest Tywat Pare will give
      the PC a blessed amulet of order, an extraordinarily useful item.
      If the PC has done <i>both</i> the Kranach quest and the
      Hotzenplotz quest, Tywat Pare will also teach the PC the Law skill
      after completing the Hotzenplotz quest.</p>
    <p> An amulet of order is also available from Tywat Pare if a lawful
      PC lures him to a location where outlaw types can be found.
      Lawenilothehl is good for this, but a random wilderness encounter
      with bandits will also work. Tywat Pare says "Let's slay some evil
      bandits!" and the game generates the message "He hands you a
      deputy's badge." The badge is in fact an amulet of order, which
      ordinarily seems to be uncursed. Cursed or blessed amulets are
      possible. Note that this does not work with raiders/raider lord
      despite existing bounties. Also, if he spots a criminal in the
      same area as the PC but out of his/her sight, the player will be
      interrupted by a message about somebody shouting
      "*Yippieyayyay!*".</p>
    <p> Tywat Pare will also pay a bounty for the corpse of the
      following outlaw types. There is also an alignment boost of bounty
      / 2. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>cutpurse: 5 </li>
      <li>mugger: 50 </li>
      <li>outlaw: 75 </li>
      <li>bandit: 75 </li>
      <li>raider: 100 </li>
      <li>outlaw leader: 100 </li>
      <li>assassin: 100 </li>
      <li>raider lord: 300 </li>
      <li>master assassin: 500 </li>
      <li>black druid: 1000 (giving this corpse to druid is preferable)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Tywat can be lured out of Terinyo by leaving town with him
      standing on an adjacent square. He will then follow the PC to
      whichever location is visited next. For low level, weak PCs, such
      as Mindcrafters, this can be extremely helpful in a wilderness
      ambush. Though he is not tame, he is friendly, and if the PC lures
      the crowd of monsters near Tywat, he will reliably kill one or two
      on each pass. He can also be brought to the Small Cave, and
      monsters can be lured to him. Since the XP is not the PC's, the
      danger level will not increase. He can also be used as a
      "first-kill-filter" for players who would attempt an ultra ending,
      but would prefer also to get the Courage skill.</p>
    <p> <a name="1.2.1.1"></a></p>
    <h4>1.2.1.1 Kranach, the raider lord <tt>@</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 15, PV: 3, Hits: 38, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d8+3, Speed: 105.</pre>
    Kranach and his gang can be found in the wilderness around Terinyo.
    Finding him is a matter of chance and thus can require considerable
    game time (and therefore food). The message "You encounter a group
    of roving raiders" specifically designates this encounter. There is
    an experience point limit for this quest. In general, Kranach flees
    the Drakalor Chain if the PC reaches experience level six. The
    exception is Trolls, who require more experience to advance in
    level. The exact limit is 5 000 xp. Note the experience level six
    disqualification especially in the case of Mindcrafters, who are
    very weak in melee in the early game. They do not gain a true
    offensive Mindcraft ability until they reach experience level six.
    Therefore it is very desirable to engage Kranach and his gang with a
    Mindcrafter that is just about to achieve experience level six.
    Ideally, the first or second kill after finding Kranach should raise
    the Mindcrafter PC to experience level six. Note that if your
    companion kills Kranach, you will fail the quest. Kranach is able to
    shoot arrows from great distances and his missile attacks can deal
    considerable amounts of damage.
    <p> If Kranach leaves a corpse be sure to collect it and attempt to
      get it back to Tywat Pare in Terinyo. When given the corpse, he
      pays a bounty of 300 gold pieces and remarks "We'll put up his
      head in some public location." Later, on entering Munxip's food
      store, the PC receives the message "A mummified skull hangs over
      the door of this shop." Giving Kranach's corpse to the sheriff
      seems to be the only way for this quest to end up in the final
      log's achievement list. Since said corpse only has a 10% chance of
      dropping, managing that is thus a matter of luck.</p>
    <p> Note that Kranach is one of an exclusive few unique NPCs who can
      be wished for.</p>

    <h4>1.2.2 Rynt, the village elder <tt>t</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 9, PV: 0, Hits: 14, Attacks: 2, Damage: 1d6+1, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Rynt provides a quest, which is mutually exclusive with Guth'Alak's
    quest. The quest is to find the village carpenter Yrrigs who has
    disappeared in a nearby dungeon (which does not appear unless the
    quest has been assigned). The reward for this quest is lower prices
    in Munxip's food store and some directions on how to proceed with
    the game - namely go to the Caverns of Chaos and try save the world
    from the incursions of Chaos. Depending on exactly how the quest is
    completed, there are additional rewards available - see section <a
      href="#1.6">1.6</a>. The PC will receive lawful boosts during this
    quest, once for luring Yrrigs to Jharod and once for reporting back
    to Rynt.
    <p> Rynt is also a source of alignment boost when <tt>g</tt>iven
      healing items or stethoscope: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>potion of healing: 50 </li>
      <li>potion of cure poison: 100 </li>
      <li>potion of extra healing: 150 </li>
      <li>potion of ultra healing: 250 </li>
      <li>stethoscope: 250 </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>1.2.3 Guth'Alak, the druid <tt>@</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 20, PV: 12, Hits: 72, Attacks: 2, Damage: 4d6, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Guth'Alak lives in the central area of Terinyo. He provides two
    quests. The first is to find and kill an evil chaotic druid,
    Keethrax, who is found in a dungeon southeast of Terinyo - see
    section <a href="#1.7">1.7</a>. Note that this quest and Rynt's are
    mutually exclusive. There are two sets of rewards for this quest,
    chosen by the PC. The PC may choose between <tt>k</tt>nowledge and
    <tt>p</tt>ower. Choosing power results in gifts of a wand of cold
    and a spellbook of Frost Bolt. Choosing knowledge results in
    Guth'Alak teaching the PC the Herbalism skill, or Gardening, if the
    PC already has Herbalism at 100. Guth'Alak provides different
    rewards to Druids who complete this quest: amulet of balance, ring
    of minor elemental mastery, and bracers of toughness [+0,+0] {To+4}.
    The exact status of these three items varies. If the PC completes
    the first Keethrax quest but only gets back to Guth'Alak after
    reaching level 30, the rewards will be lost forever. Ordinarily,
    this should never happen.
    <p> Guth'Alak's second quest is available only after the PC reaches
      experience level 30. The quest is to find and help the Greater
      White Unicorn, Yrruir. This is the only way to access the unicorn
      quests, whether the PC chooses to attempt Yrruir's quest or
      Riurry's quest. See section <a href="#2.19">2.19</a>.</p>
    <p> Note that Guth'Alak's quests are Neutral. They draw alignment
      towards N=. If the PC's alignment is on the lawful side of N=,
      these quests are technically a chaotic act.</p>
    <p> Guth'Alak will provide potion of corruption for the corpse of
      the following monsters: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Snake from Beyond </li>
      <li>Master Summoner </li>
      <li>Ancient Stone Beast </li>
      <li>Ancient Chaos Wyrm </li>
      <li>Greater Black Unicorn </li>
      <li>Chaos Archmage </li>
      <li>Black Druid </li>
      <li>Emperor Moloch </li>
      <li>Multi-Headed Chaos Dragon </li>
      <li>black unicorn </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Note that black unicorns are only non-unique monsters in this
      list. Since black unicorns are available as a wilderness encounter
      he technically is an unlimited source of corruption removal. Note
      that only neutral or lawful PCs are able to receive rewards for
      corpses. Guth'Alak will take the chaos corpses from chaotic PCs
      but will not give a reward.</p>
    <p> Guth'Alak can turn hostile if the PC tries to chop trees in
      Terinyo. Even in his hostile state, he never leaves the water area
      in Terinyo to pursue the PC. He is capable of defending himself
      and the residents of Terinyo with glowing balls, can cast
      confusion, and can walk on water. As his evil black counterpart,
      he is immune to non-acid elemental attacks. He will help the PC
      fight Munxip if the PC angers Munxip with the right tactics.
      Guth'Alak is the target of Kherab's first quest.</p>

    <h4>1.2.4 Tiny Girl <tt>t</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 7, PV: 0, Hits: 1, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d1, Speed: 100.</pre>
    The Tiny Girl is one of the many children of Terinyo. She is source
    of a quest. The objective is to rescue her puppy from a dungeon
    northeast of Terinyo. The reward for the quest is a lawful boost and
    a piece of candy from the Tiny Girl. Note that this quest is
    difficult and entirely optional.
    <p> The general approach should be to get to the bottom of the
      dungeon, carefully find the puppy and get out as fast as possible
      with a minimum of fighting. Note also that if the puppy is
      generated dead, retrieving the corpse and returning it to the Tiny
      Girl still provides some lawful boost. Furthermore this means that
      the quest can be done <i>at any time</i> after the PC has gained
      experience thus having a better chance of surviving the dungeon.
      Another way to do this quest is to just wish for a cute dog. See
      section <a href="#1.8">1.8</a> for more details.</p>
    <p> If during the quest the PC kills the Cute Dog, and decides to
      tell the Tiny Girl "The truth behind (their) evil deed", she will
      turn hostile. When this happens, she can be killed without
      angering the rest of the townsfolk of Terinyo.</p>
    <p> <a name="1.2.5"></a></p>
    <h4>1.2.5 Blup, the baby water dragon <tt>D</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 15, PV: 2, Hits: 26, Attacks: 3, Damage: 6d2+3, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Blup is the only non-human resident of Terinyo; so is not hard to
    spot there. He asks the PC to find his mother - the great water
    dragon Shyssiryxius. This is not something low level PCs should
    attempt. It requires the ability to breathe water, or <i>very</i>
    careful planning. There are also very dangerous monsters found in
    the underwater cave. Once the PC finds her, chats to her and returns
    to Blup with the news, she will receive an alignment boost and
    (eventually) an artifact, the Rune Covered Trident. More details can
    be found in section <a href="#2.13">2.13</a>.
    <p> Blup will also teach the Swimming skill if given one blessed or
      two uncursed potions of carrot juice.</p>
    <p> Bringing civil disorder to Terinyo will usually make him
      hostile; though if the PC is caught shoplifting without angering
      the rest of the populace, he will actually fight alongside
      Guth'Alak against the summoned thugs. Whilst not nearly as strong
      as his mother, Blup's water breath attack is still something to be
      cautious of all the same.</p>
    <p> Blup enjoys candy more than children do (+10 alignment for
      giving candy to Blup, +2 for children).</p>

    <pre>Level: 10, DV: 16, PV: 10, Hits 290, Attacks: 3, Damage: 3d6+18. Speed: 140.</pre>
    Munxip owns a specialty shop "Munxip's Magnificent Munchies Mall",
    selling food only. 5/6 of items in Munxip's shops are large rations.
    Like all shopkeepers, he is <i>tough</i>. It is best for low level
    PCs to buy from his shop without attempting anything dishonest. It
    is possible for PCs with low Strength to simply pick up, without
    paying for, enough large rations to train Strength if the PC runs
    around in his shop long enough. Munxip will block the door so the PC
    will not be interrupted. Just do not attempt to leave without
    paying. ;-)
    <p> Upon successful completion of Rynt's quest to save Yrrigs,
      Munxip will lower all his prices as thanks for saving his friend.</p>

    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 16, PV: 0, Hits: 18, Attacks: 2, Damage: 3d3+1, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Yggaz is a source of rumors (see section <a href="#0.15.8.2">0.15.8.2</a>)
    and will trade random potions for potions of booze. This can be
    quite useful, as beggars in the nearby outlaw town of Lawenilothehl
    will give you a potion of booze in return for ~40 gp.
    <p> <a name="1.2.8"></a></p>
    <h4>1.2.8 Townspeople <tt>t</tt></h4>
    <pre>Farmer: Level: 1, DV: 11, PV: 0, Hits: 6, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d6+1, Speed: 100.
Goodwife: Level: 1, DV: 9, PV: 0, Hits: 4, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d4, Speed: 100.
Child: Level: 1, DV: 7, PV: 0, Hits: 1, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d1, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Farmers are found in Terinyo. A farmer corpse is a quest object for
    Gaab'Baay (see section <a href="#2.1.6">2.1.6</a>). Farmers
    will also provide rations and +10 alignment for tools, such as a
    scythe, and will accept seeds for a small lawful boost. The
    remaining townspeople - goodwives and children - are simply flavor
    elements without any real importance in the game. They can be used
    as cannon fodder, of course. Lure them out of town to kill them for
    experience. Train Ventriloquism on them and they can then be
    slaughtered right in town without consequence. Confusion Blast works
    similarly. If a C alignment is desired (for robbing Munxip without
    cursing, for example), anything goes.

    <h4>1.2.9 Magical island <tt>.</tt></h4>
    The magical island is a single tile surrounded by water in the

    Lawenilothehl is an outlaw village found to the southwest of
    Terinyo. The name is an anagram of "hole in the wall", American
    slang for a shabby place. It contains a variety of shady characters
    who can be useful.<br>

    <h4>1.3.1 Yergius, the master thief <tt>@</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 32, PV: 7, Hits: 88, Attacks: 2, Damage: 1d6+9, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Yergius is the head of the Thieves' Guild. He can teach or train a
    variety of useful skills for non-lawful PCs. They are Climbing,
    Detect Traps, Disarm traps, Pick locks, Pick Pockets and Stealth.
    Yergius teaches Pick Pockets to any non-lawful PC at no cost. Bear
    in mind that obtaining even the Pick Pockets skill from Yergius is a
    chaotic act. He will only teach or train the remainder of these
    skills once the PC has demonstrated his talents as a thief. In
    practice, this means that the PC must successfully use the Pick
    Pockets skill 28 times (according to the recent best estimates)
    against monsters vulnerable to this skill. This includes most
    humanoids, constructs and undead. Animals in general do not have
    pockets to pick, although ratlings (not rats or giant rats, but
    archers, duelists, fencers, etc.) are vulnerable. A successful
    application of the skill will result in a stolen item being added to
    the PC's inventory, or the message "The -foo- does not seem to own
    anything of value." Note that Yergius' initial training results in a
    Pick Pockets skill level of one. This means that it is not really
    useful for picking pockets until it is trained and an experience
    level or two has been gained, thus making it eligible for
    advancement. It is useful for angering nonhostile villagers. Those
    villagers in line of sight may also become hostile. Fumbled Pick
    Pockets attempts are thus a way to generate hostile villagers
    without Confusion Blast, Stun Ray or Ventriloquism. Thrundarr has
    been moved off his lever with a low Pick Pockets skill. Using the
    Pick Pockets skill is a relatively minor chaotic act, and
    furthermore seems to have a limited alignment effect. PCs never seem
    to become C- by using Pick Pockets.
    <p> It is also apparently possible to satisfy Yergius by robbing
      shops, but the quantitation is not understood. Furthermore, he
      will not teach Pick Pockets to a PC that has already robbed a
      shop. So if you want a PC to have access to the Pick Pockets
      skill, do not rob shops before obtaining the skill. Robbing shops
      is a very risky activity for PCs with less than experience level
      20 anyway.</p>
    <p> The main initial reason for attempting this quest is to satisfy
      Yergius and receive the Detect Traps skill from him. This makes
      the underground level of the Dwarven Graveyard and the Pyramid in
      general much easier and safer, not to mention the elemental
      temples.</p>
    <p> After satisfying Yergius he will teach new skills for prices
      ranging from 3500 - 5000 gold pieces. Detect Traps in particular
      is well worth the 3500 gold pieces it costs. He will also offer
      training of two different types: <tt>t</tt>heoretical and <tt>p</tt>ractical.
      Theoretical training will raise the PC's dice modifier available
      when experience level advancement occurs. The maximum is +4d5.
      This is simply a matter of cash. If the PC has plenty of money
      available and wants to maximize a skill that Yergius trains
      quickly, pay him whatever is required to get the modifier to +4d5.
      The second form of training he offers is practical. When the PC
      trains in this way, it adds successful skill checks to the skill,
      making it easier to advance. This also is a matter of cash. It is
      a very good idea to use this practical training if the PC is about
      to face an area where a newly learned skill will be needed. Again,
      the underground level of the Dwarven Graveyard and the Pyramid are
      obvious examples of areas where the Detect Traps skill will be
      needed, while the PC has probably had little time to train the
      skill.</p>
    <p> Another example where Yergius' theoretical and practical
      training can be very useful is the Climbing skill. Climbing = 100
      is required for entering the Rift, which is something all
      spellcasters should seriously consider for access to the Sinister
      Library of Niltrias. Trolls should also visit the Library for
      much-needed experience. It is possible to train Climbing without
      Yergius' assistance, for example by mountaineering, but this takes
      place in the wilderness, thus wasting large amounts of valuable
      time.</p>
    <p> The following table summarizes the costs for Yergius training:</p>

    <p> Yergius will never move from his position (unless hostile), but
      can be swapped with using the <tt>:s</tt> command. This can be
      exploited to block doorways or other passages - notably, he can be
      used to block the exit to the Black Market, which can allow the PC
      to rob the store (not without risk, however).</p>
    <p> PCs who kill Yergius become the new head of the Thieves' Guild
      and as such receive 50% off the prices at Barnabas' black market
      (see next section). Of course killing him means that he is no
      longer available for training, so take advantage of his training
      before killing him.</p>
    <p> Yergius also sells thieves picks to non-lawful PCs with the Pick

    Barnabas maintains a general store type of shop in Lawenilothehl. As
    might be expected from the general atmosphere in the town, it is a
    black market. As such, the prices demanded are very high.
    Nevertheless, it is worth visiting. Simply observing what is for
    sale identifies items. Barnabas also usually has rocks for sale at
    relatively reasonable prices, which can be tremendously useful for
    Hurthlings. Barnabas occasionally has high quality items for sale,
    which can be within the monetary reach of PCs who have done the
    Kranach quest. In addition to the 50% reduction in prices for being
    head of the Thieves' Guild (see above section 1.3.1), Barnabas also
    changes his offers when the PC sells items: 1/4 of base value for
    nonmembers, 1/3 of base value for members and 1/2 of base value if
    the PC is the head of the Thieves' Guild, regardless of whether she
    was a former member.

    Kranf Niest appears to be always busy planning experiments, and
    serves little purpose in the game. Hovewer, he can teach PCs the
    Healing skill after completing Hotzenplotz's Kill Jharod quest. He
    does not have the gentle touch of Jharod (however he will teach
    Healing at 60 value, whereas Jharod provides only 10-20 value). When
    a chaotic PC learns the Healing skill from him, the PC is teleported
    away in a stunned and confused state, loses 1d3 points in each of
    the Appearance, Learning and Willpower categories and is corrupted
    slightly (1%). During this process, Kranf Niest removes any helmet
    the PC might be wearing, even if it is cursed. If the PC already has
    Healing, Kranf Niest gives the PC a scalpel and a stethoscope. It is
    a chaotic act to attack Kranf Niest, but the PC receives a small net
    lawful boost for killing him.

    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 25, PV: 2, Hits: 32, Attacks: 3, Damage: 1d6+5, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Skriek sells random keys. The prices for males seem exorbitant (470
    + 30*level gold), but they can save a PC's life. Female PCs receive
    a 50% discount. Note that Skriek becomes hostile if the PC attacks
    Hotzenplotz, one of Tywat Pare's quests. He is quite evasive, but
    overall not a very dangerous opponent. He can be lured away from the
    bandit village, for example to Terinyo, where he will sell keys even
    after Hotzenplotz is killed.

Half-orc bouncer: Level: 1, DV: 12, PV: 12, Hits: 64, Attacks: 2, Damage: 2d8+8, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Hotzenplotz assigns two quests. The first is to kill Jharod, the
    healer. Jharod, and thus this quest, is only available if the PC has
    chosen Rynt's Yrrigs quest rather than Guth'Alak's Keethrax quest.
    Hotzenplotz arranges for Kranf Niest to teach the Healing skill as a
    reward. The second is to kill Tywat Pare. The reward is an amulet of
    chaos. If the PC is on a mission from Tywat Pare to kill
    Hotzenplotz, a couple of points are worth remembering. Attacking
    Hotzenplotz will cause most of the inhabitants of Lawenilothehl to
    become hostile, with the exceptions of Barnabas,Yergius and Kranf
    Niest. Hotzenplotz is fairly tough, bypasses PV and uses poison. He
    will kill a PC without poison resistance in melee quite easily.
    However, he does not heal. A PC can attack him, run away into the
    wilderness and repeat this process until he is dead. The combination
    of these two characteristics should make it clear that the best way
    to attack him is with missiles or ranged spells.
    <p> It is possible for a relatively low level PC (especially
      Hurthlings) to kill him with thrown rocks, but special tactics are
      necessary. Lure him out of his hut and flee towards the right side
      of town while pelting him with rocks. Leave town and reenter from
      the left. Continue to throw rocks until he succumbs.</p>
    <p> Hotzenplotz's guards, Grunge and Munge, will become hostile if
      either they are attacked, or Hotzenplotz is attacked; meaning that
      PCs undertaking the Kill Hotzenplotz quest will have to fight them
      as well (or just run away). Unlike Hotzenplotz, the guards are
      orcs so they see in darkness.</p>
    <p> Hotzenplotz and his guards can be exploited. They will often
      attack hostile monsters that are led into their hut. If one of the
      nastier monsters found in Lawenilothehl (assassin, outlaw leader)
      attacks a weak PC, run for Hotzenplotz's hut.</p>
    <p> When killed, Hotzenplotz typically drops from 1500 to 6000 gold
      pieces.</p>

    The other inhabitants are simply flavor elements with no real role
    in the game. They include beggars, assassins, muggers, cutpurses,
    bandits, outlaws and outlaw leaders. Beggars are useful because they
    can drop a potion of booze if the PC <tt>g</tt>ives them 40 or more
    gold pieces and then <tt>C</tt>hats with them. There is a 50%
    chance they'll give you a fortune cookie message instead; if so, try
    again until they give you booze. Each beggar can only give 1 potion
    of booze. It is always cursed. Remember Yggaz, the fool in Terinyo,
    will trade random potions for potions of booze. Giving food to
    beggars raises alignment by nutrition value / 10, but min 10 and max
    100.
    <p> Corpses of the other Lawenilothehl inhabitants yield reward from
      Tywat Pare in Terinyo.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Small Cave and Unremarkable Dungeon</h3>
    <a name="1.4.1"></a>
    <h4>1.4.1 Objectives, strategy for survival and items found in the
      Small Cave</h4>
    The Small Cave is a popular place to start the game. It contains one
    very useful guaranteed item and few other non-guaranteed desirable
    items. The guaranteed items in the Small Cave are:
    <ul>
      <li>scroll of information (at entrance) <tt>?</tt> </li>
      <li>scroll of warning (at entrance) <tt>?</tt> </li>
      <li>waterproof blanket (in the room farthest from entrance) <tt>]</tt>
      </li>
      <li>armor <tt>[</tt> </li>
      <li>3x one-handed weapon <tt>(</tt><tt>(</tt><tt>(</tt> </li>
      <li>2x two-handed weapon <tt>(</tt><tt>(</tt> </li>
      <li>shield <tt>[</tt> </li>
      <li>cloak <tt>[</tt> </li>
    </ul>
    <p> The scroll of information simply tells how many paces away the
      waterproof blanket is. The scroll of warning gives some advice
      about tactics for the Small Cave. It reads "Time is working
      against you!" This is true. When the PC enters the Small Cave,
      monsters are generated on the level as is true of any dungeon
      level. As the original monsters are killed off, new monsters are
      generated. The new monsters are generated differently than on any
      other level in the game. They have approximately double the
      experience level of the PC. As might be imagined, this quickly
      gets very difficult to cope with and is the basis for the eternium
      man challenge game (see <a href="#Appendix_R">Appendix R</a>). This offers
      a way to quickly gain experience levels, but as a rule, PCs should
      get out of the Small Cave by experience level 5 at most.</p>
    <p> The Small Cave also contains a down staircase which leads to the
      Unremarkable Dungeon. The Unremarkable Dungeon is normal in terms
      of danger and monster generation. It is also essential to enter
      the Unremarkable Dungeon at some point if the PC plans to try a
      special ending.</p>
    <p> Out of depth weapons are sometimes found in the Small Cave.
      Eternium two-handed swords and halberds of defense are examples.
      Artifacts can be generated in the Small Cave, but this is rare.
      Altars can also be generated in the Small Cave.</p>
    <p> The general strategy for the Small Cave is to get in, find the
      waterproof blanket as quickly as possible, optionally find the
      down staircase and get out. Getting out can be via descent through
      the Unremarkable Dungeon or ascent back to the wilderness.</p>
    <p> Note that the monsters generated in the Small Cave are in
      general common types: goblins, kobolds, bats, rats and the like.
      Making a first kill in the Small Cave is not a good idea if a
      special ending is planned (see section <a href="#0.9.1">0.9.1</a>).</p>
    <p> <a name="1.4.2"></a></p>
    <h4>1.4.2 Should PCs descend through the Unremarkable Dungeon?</h4>
    After retrieving the waterproof blanket and locating the down stairs
    in the Small Cave (easier said than done), PCs may choose to descend
    through the Unremarkable Dungeon. As mentioned, it is essential to
    go through this dungeon in order to complete a special ending. If
    the PC chooses to do this, the Kranach quest will be lost, since the
    PC will be greater than experience level six by the time the
    Unremarkable Dungeon is traversed. The chance to complete the Puppy
    quest successfully will also be lost, since the four day time limit
    will expire by the time the PC manages to get back to Terinyo.
    Despite the fact that monsters are generated in the Small Cave at
    twice the PC's experience level, it is possible to leave the Small
    Cave and reenter it later in order to gain access to the
    Unremarkable Dungeon. It can be done using invisibility. The
    monsters generated are high level relative to the PC, but they are
    not in general "special" monsters that have the ability to see
    invisible. Thus a high level PC can use invisibility to make a quick
    dash through the Small Cave and descend to the Unremarkable Dungeon.
    <p> Items that grant invisibility are by no means guaranteed so this
      strategy is not available to every PC. Many players will descend
      through the Unremarkable Dungeon every time if possible.
      Alternatively, a higher level PC can attempt to avoid killing
      anything on his search for the down staircase. This is sometimes
      impossible and risky in any case.</p>
    <p> Starting the game in the SMC and descending through the UD is
      considered somewhat of a challenge, often rewarded with superior
      equipment (eg. tower crystal shields, mithril scale mails) and
      very quick level and power increases and access to the HMV -
      provided the PC has what it takes.</p>
    <p> <a name="1.4.3"></a></p>
    <h4>1.4.3 Unremarkable Dungeon</h4>
    The Unremarkable Dungeon is (probably deliberately by TB) misnamed.
    It is quite remarkable. It generally contains more special features
    - altars, pools, forges, herbs, shops and the like, than any other
    dungeon in the game. These are all nice features. The Unremarkable
    Dungeon also seems to contain more door traps and tension rooms than
    any other dungeon, which is not so nice.
    <p> However, there are no truly guaranteed features in the UD. It is
      very possible to get a streak of entirely mundane levels. While
      there is arguably no increased chance to find a river, if they
      appear they may be more of an issue, since the route back through
      the Small Cave may well turn out to be virtual suicide.</p>
    <p> In any case, the bottom of the Unremarkable Dungeon, UD:8,
      contains two up staircases. One of the staircases leads to the
      High Mountain Village.</p>
    <p> <a name="1.4.4"></a></p>
    <h4>1.4.4 High Mountain Village - introduction</h4>
    The High Mountain Village is an interesting wilderness location. It
    contains a shop and various NPCs who are mostly useful to chaotics
    and essential for those PCs attempting a special ending. One
    significant problem is the possibility of meeting a Stone Giant Lord
    upon entering the High Mountain Village. This monster is very
    difficult to defeat for a relatively low level PC that has descended
    directly from the Small Cave through the Unremarkable Dungeon to the
    High Mountain Village. The Stone Giant Lord is not generated every
    time, but the possibility is an argument against entering the
    Unremarkable Dungeon directly from the Small Cave with a low level
    PC. If that is the plan, enter with full HPs and Coward tactics. It
    is possible to lure the Stone Giant Lord, and monsters in general,
    to the right side of the map, leave and reenter from the left. If
    you can swim or create an ice bridge, you can also evade monsters by
    entering through a small opening in the north part of the moat,
    where water flows inside the village.
    <p> The High Mountain Village contains a hidden exit to the northern
      central part of the wilderness map. It is found from the inside of
      the western village wall. This means that the PC need not go all
      the way back through the Unremarkable Dungeon and the Small Cave
      in order to exit.</p>
    <p> More on the High Mountain Village is found in section <a
        "#2.1"="">2.1</a>.</p>

    More about the Infinite Dungeon (ID) can be found in section <a

    the game.
    <p> <a name="1.5.1"></a></p>
    <h4>1.5.1 Why start the game in the Infinite Dungeon?</h4>
    Starting the game in the ID is a very conservative approach for PCs
    that are weak at the start of the game. Given the significance of
    the first kill, it is probably not advisable to make the first kill
    in the ID, but gaining further experience while staying on level one
    of the ID is about as safe as things get in ADOM. The PC can flee
    from anything threatening, such as dark rooms or tension rooms, by
    exiting the ID and reentering. This strategy is one way to get
    difficult classes to experience level five or so before the ID
    becomes intolerably tedious.

    <h3>1.6 Village Dungeon</h3>
    The Village Dungeon is where Yrrigs can be found, after receiving
    the quest from Rynt. It is southeast of Terinyo. It consists of
    seven levels. The first six seem to never have any dungeon features
    besides altars. A tension room is sometimes found on the seventh
    level. Two important NPCs are found in the Village Dungeon.
    <p> <a name="1.6.1"></a></p>
    <h4>1.6.1 Jharod, the healer <tt>@</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 10, PV: 0, Hits: 12, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d8+3, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Jharod is found on level four of the Village Dungeon. He will
    completely heal the player - no matter their alignment - up to seven
    times. This healing includes treatment of sickness or poison, which
    can otherwise be fatal if left untreated. This means you can safely
    consume kobold shaman corpses if Jharod is near.
    <p> He also will teach the player the Healing skill if they prove
      their ability to show mercy, and the PC is not chaotic. This can
      be done in two ways. The first is healing wounded monsters with
      any healing spell or potions of healing. The wounded monster must
      not have been damaged by the PC. A pet can wound the monster. The
      second involves Yrrigs the carpenter.</p>
    <p> If you already have the Healing skill and <tt>C</tt>hat with
      Jharod after showing mercy, he'll give you a stethoscope. If you
      already have Healing at 100, showing mercy and chatting to Jharod
      will yield a potion of ultra healing. There is no limit to how
      many potions can be obtained in this manner, potentially allowing
      the player to inflate maximum HP to very high values.</p>
    <p> Jharod is the subject of the Kill Jharod quest, assigned by
      Hotzenplotz under certain conditions. PCs intending to kill Jharod
      will not find him a particularly dangerous opponent. Jharod is
      able to rapidly regenerate his wounds (basically requiring one hit
      kill), however.</p>
    <p> <a name="1.6.2"></a></p>
    <h4>1.6.2 Yrrigs, the mad carpenter <tt>t</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 20, PV: 0, Hits: 80, Attacks: 2, Damage: 1d8+3, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Yrrigs is the Village Carpenter from Terinyo. A short time before
    the game began, he left the village to explore the Village Dungeon.
    While there, he was corrupted by the essence of chaos and became
    mad.
    <p> Yrrigs can be found on the last level of the dungeon, level
      seven. He will be a purple <tt>t</tt> and will be hostile. He is
      moderately dangerous. Despite his purple color, Yrrigs does not
      have a corrupting melee attack, nor does using Mindcraft against
      him corrupt a Mindcrafter. Ideally he should be led to Jharod, who
      will heal him. Yrrigs recovers from his illness and leaves a
      Manual of Bridge Building, a hatchet and a cursed oil of rust
      removal as rewards. While leading Yrrigs to Jharod, the PC should
      use tactics that are as defensive as possible. This means using
      the 'Coward' setting and possibly dual-wielding shields. Problems
      arise when the PC encounters other monsters that must be fought on
      the way back to Jharod, of course. It is possible to complete
      Rynt's quest by killing Yrrigs. In this case Yrrigs drops his
      items immediately, but the PC must demonstrate mercy in another
      way in order to receive the Healing skill from Jharod, and Rynt
      does not lower the prices in Munxip's shop. After saving Yrrigs,
      he changes color to green, loses 10 hp, can be found in Terinyo
      and can further train the Bridge Building skill. Note that it is
      possible for a chaotic PC to lead Yrrigs to Jharod, change
      alignment at a later time and still receive the Healing skill from
      him. Similarly, it is possible for a PC to heal a monster earlier
      in the game in which case Jharod will grant the Healing skill upon
      meeting the PC.</p>

    <h3>1.7 Druid Dungeon</h3>
    The Druid Dungeon is a dungeon southeast of Terinyo that will appear
    after the Kill Keethrax quest has been assigned. It consists of
    seven levels, with the corrupted evil druid Keethrax living on the
    bottom level.
    <p> Much like the Village Dungeon, the Druid Dungeon does not have
      most dungeon features; altars and tension rooms may be generated,
      but herbs, forges, etc. generally may not be. The bottom level is
      unique in that, aside from Keethrax, only animals may be found on
      this floor. Unlike other places, animals here are hostile towards
      PCs of the Druid class. Additionally, animals on Keethrax's level
      can't be calmed (using the Calm Monster spell results in the
      target "ignoring the spell"); and possibly can't be tamed.</p>
    <p> The following animals are generated on DD:7: cave bear, cave
      fisher, cave lion, cave lizard, cave tiger, cobra, dire wolf, fire
      beetle, fire lizard, giant bat, giant centipede, giant frog, giant
      lizard, giant raccoon, giant rat, giant slug, giant spider, huge
      bat, hyena, jackal, large snake, large spider, rabid dog, rat,
      rattlesnake, silver wolf, tarantula, viper, wild cat, wolf.</p>
    <p> <a name="1.7.1"></a></p>
    <h4>1.7.1 Keethrax, the black druid <tt>@</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 15, PV: 4, Hits: 72, Attacks: 1, Damage: 3d3+1, Speed: 125.</pre>
    Keethrax's stats are directly proportional to your level when first
    entering DD:7. As a druid, he maintains a contingent of hostile
    animals on the final level. These will include felines (see section
    <a href="#0.9.2">0.9.2</a>) and giant slugs (nasty acid
    breathers, but their corpses are a source of acid immunity). He is
    vulnerable to acid and magic missiles, but little else in the way of
    magic. He can however be stunned via the Stun Ray spell or the wand,
    paralyzed with a wand of paralyzation, and blinded with a cursed
    potion of invisibility. He casts Darkness, can see in darkness,
    attacks with missiles (source of sling bullets) and glowing balls,
    heals himself, while he can drain attributes and use curses in melee
    range. He has a corrupting melee attack. All of this makes a
    formidable enemy for PCs less than experience level ten. Some
    players regard him as an out-of-depth opponent and defer this quest
    until later in the game. He carries an artifact, the Black Torc,
    which is a decent missile weapon but permanently cursed. It is good
    fodder for the Demented Ratling (see section <a href="#3.5.8"
     >3.5.8</a>).
    <pre>------------------------ black torc [+4, +2] (+10 spd) ------------------------

When worn it modifies DV by +4 and PV by +2.

When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+2
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +2 bonus to hit and
causes 2d6+2 points of damage.

It is an undead slayer.
It is a permanently cursed item.
This weapon returns when thrown.
It modifies your speed by +10.
It grants resistance to fire.
It grants resistance to cold.
It grants bad luck.
It grants resistance to shock attacks.
</pre>
    Keethrax always leaves a corpse. Picking up his corpse is a chaotic
    act, but Guth'Alak will reward non-chaotic PCs with a potion of cure
    corruption in exchange for returning Keethrax's corpse to him.
    Eating the corpse will corrupt (nearly one full corruption). It also
    results in -1000 alignment drop and attribute changes: +2 Le, +1 To,
    +3 Ma and -4 Wi.

    <h3>1.8 Puppy Cave</h3>
    The Puppy dungeon is six levels deep; the puppy is on the last
    level. There are some guaranteed features in the dungeon. The first
    is a hive of giant ants, always found on the second level. These are
    very difficult to kill for a low level PC and ideally should be
    avoided completely. They can be easily killed if you bolt them with
    spells or wands. Their corpses will make the PC vomit and lose some
    satiation, but grant acid resistance, an otherwise rare intrinsic.
    The second is an open cavernous level on the fifth level with a high
    monster generation rate that is characteristic of these open levels.
    Finally, there is a lesser vault on the last level of the dungeon.
    The puppy generally can be found without fighting through the vault;
    this is the best course of action. There is no chance of other
    vaults except the one at PC6. It is worthwhile to do visit this
    dungeon even if the time limit for the Puppy quest has passed, since
    shops, altars, herbs and pools can be generated in this dungeon.
    Hives containing bees are common but not guaranteed.
    <p> The last level must be entered before four days of game time
      have elapsed, otherwise the puppy is generated as a corpse,
      presumably dying from starvation. The corpse can still be given to
      the Tiny Girl for a slight lawful boost, or you can just tell girl
      it died for the same result, even without corpse in inventory. The
      cute dog corpse will not rot, however eating it will both curse
      and doom, so should be done only in an emergency if at all.</p>
    <p> <a name="1.8.1"></a></p>
    <h4>1.8.1 Cute Dog <tt>d</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 32, PV: 0, Hits: 6, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d3, Speed: 130.</pre>
    If the player reaches the bottom level before 4 ingame days have
    passed, the Cute Dog will be generated as a tame pet, which will
    follow the player around and help you fight monsters. However, if it
    takes more than 4 days to reach the bottom of the cave, then the
    Cute Dog will not be generated; instead you will find a cute dog
    corpse somewhere on the level.
    <p> As might be expected, the Cute Dog is an eager, but not very
      good fighter, and it is quite frail, so if it starts a fight, be
      sure to be around to end it before the dog is hurt. Try to avoid
      luring it into traps if at all possible - a single corruption trap
      will transform it into a writhing mass of primal chaos, which is
      not only a terribly tragic thing to happen but also dangerous.
      Other traps, like an acid trap or spear trap might simply kill it
      outright.</p>
    <p> If you return the dog to Terinyo alive, you will receive an
      alignment boost and the ability to randomly receive a piece of
      candy by talking to the Tiny Girl. Note that when you enter
      Terinyo, the dog will stop following you and instead follow the
      Tiny Girl around.</p>
    <p> The Cute Dog is one of the few unique monsters that can be
      wished for. A wished-for Cute Dog at any point of the game will
      satisfy the Puppy quest requirement if returned to Terinyo.
      Bringing multiple cute dogs to Terinyo will not give multiple
      alignment boosts.</p>

    <h3>1.9 Places to avoid in the early game</h3>
    There are a few locations on the wilderness map that are to be
    avoided for low level PCs. One of the more mundane is the road found
    in the central part of the wilderness. Unfortunately, the easy
    traveling afforded by this road attracts monsters who will try to
    kill new adventurers. It is quite likely that a hostile group of
    chaos brothers and sisters will be found on this road, as well as
    wandering bands of bandits and other outlaw types, including
    assassins, who use poison. Bottom line: avoid the road with a low
    level PC. Travel through the plains and forest areas instead.
    <p> As far as truly deadly areas go, the entrance to Darkforge is
      one (section <a href="#2.4">2.4</a>). It is found in the
      central part of the map near the southern border. Darkforge itself
      is the second level of this particular dungeon. The danger level
      of the top level is not that high, but the down staircase is
      guarded by a steel golem. These are very tough monsters for a low
      level PC to defeat. A low level Wizard who has trained the
      Lightning Bolt spell may have a chance but is asking for trouble.
      Another wilderness location that will kill low level PCs very
      quickly is the Tower of Eternal Flames. Without good fire
      resistance and other special equipment, both the PC and his
      inventory will be incinerated. See section <a href="#2.5">2.5</a>
      for more on the Tower of Eternal Flames. Shyssiryxius' cave is
      difficult for low level PCs due to the need for water breathing or
      high hitpoints and on-demand teleportation, as well as the
      presence of nasty aquatic beasts such as dragon turtles (section <a
        href="#2.13">2.13</a>). The Bug Temple (section <a
        href="#2.3">2.3</a>) contains extremely dangerous bugs
      who will easily kill the unprepared. Some locations, such as the
      Rift (<a href="#2.15">2.15</a>) and the Minotaur Maze (<a
        href="#2.14">2.14</a>), do not allow low level PCs to
      enter.</p>
    <p> <a name="1.9.1"></a></p>
    <h4>1.9.1 What's next?</h4>
    After exploring the area around Terinyo, the next step is to
    undertake a trek through the wilderness to the main dungeon in the
    game, the Caverns of Chaos (CoC). If the PC chose Rynt's quest, Rynt
    will provide some advice about finding the CoC. Remember to take
    enough food to survive the trip through the wilderness! If the PC
    chose to descend through the Unremarkable Dungeon, he is already
    quite close to the entrance of the CoC, which is found in the
    western central part of the wilderness map.

    Sometimes there is a stone giant lord generated outside the High
    Mountain Village walls near where the PC enters from the wilderness.
    Needless to say, this can be a nasty surprise for a relatively low
    level PC who has descended through the Unremarkable Dungeon at the
    beginning of the game. If you can't run away, an attack with Berserk
    tactics may work if the PC has a decent weapon. He is vulnerable to
    magic. He doesn't see in darkness nor through invisibility, which
    may be used by the player to evade him.

    <h4>2.1.2 Hawkslayer, the burly adventurer <tt>@</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 24, PV: 15, Hits: 350, Attacks: 1, Damage: 4d10+10, Speed: 120.</pre>
    The burly adventurer in the High Mountain Village will join a PC and
    act as a companion providing certain criteria are met: the PC must
    be at least level 25, must not be chaotic and the player (<i>not</i>
    the PC) must know a secret password: <tt>Iceberg</tt>. The only way
    to learn the password in ADOM itself is drinking from pools, and
    many players are reluctant to do so. Some players may remember
    Hawkslayer from the computer RPG "Bard's Tale III". The password is
    the same in that game.
    <p> Hawkslayer is not super-buff as companions go, but he is not
      bad.</p>
    <p> A report from the Russian ADOM newsgroup on September 14th, 2000
      described a PC who was very careful with Hawkslayer to start,
      training him in the upper levels of the CoC, proceeding to the Big
      Room then deeper into the CoC until he was able to take on molochs
      and balors. Using a blessed stethoscope on him at that point gave
      the following:</p>
    <p> </p>
    <pre>You examine Hawkslayer, the burly adventurer. Diagnosis:
Level: 110, DV: 96, PV: 36, Hits: 805, Attacks: 11, Damage: 50-86, Speed: 120.
</pre>
    Quite impressive.
    <p> Hawkslayer uses eternium arrows which can be retrieved for the
      PC's own use.</p>
    <p> It is possible to equip Hawkslayer with items. If the PC drops
      certain equipment to the ground next to him he will pick up the
      items and equip them. Unfortunately he will not wear body armor,
      but will equip boots, cloaks, gauntlets and shields. Be very
      careful, however. He will not equip these items after he is the
      PC's companion. The items must simply be dropped next to him <i>before</i>
      giving him the secret password.</p>
    <p> <a name="2.1.3"></a></p>
    <h4>2.1.3 Ratling guardians <tt>r</tt> <tt>r</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 18, PV: 7, Hits: 35, Attacks: 1, Damage: 2d6+2, Speed: 101.</pre>
    Two ratling guardians are found at the entrance to the city. They
    seem to be flavor elements more than anything else and play no real
    role in the plot of the game.
    <p> Thanks to gut for the following:</p>
    <p> They have a peculiarity that makes them useful for one thing.
      This strategy is really only worthwhile if the PC has no means of
      teleportation, and no potions of invisibility, or Leggot sees
      invisible too quickly. They are motionless, and will let the PC
      swap places with them. This means they can be maneuvered in front
      of Leggot's shop. Place a ratling near the doorway, gather the
      shop items, repeatedly drop them and pick them up until the
      shopkeeper doesn't block the doorway (this can take many tries,
      and being fast helps), stand in the doorway, and swap places with
      the ratling. An alarm sounds, and the PC will be cursed if it's
      not chaotically aligned. Just kill or outrun the summoned thugs,
      which the PC should be able to do at this point in the game.
      Leggot won't kill the ratling to get at you, and many thugs will
      be trapped in his shop as well, they will just look on angrily as
      you leave. : )</p>

    <h4>2.1.4 Leggot, the shopkeeper <tt>@</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level 11, DV: 19, PV: 10, Hits: 350, Attacks: 3, Damage: 3d6+18, Speed: 150.</pre>
    Leggot may offer better prices than Waldenbrook, the shopkeeper in
    Dwarftown, both when selling items and buying items. He does not
    share Waldenbrook's hatred of Dark Elves. Leggot's race varies
    between games; though he is most commonly either a gnome or dwarf.
    There is a smaller chance that he will be a human or troll.

    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 13, PV: 13, Hits: 90, Attacks: 1, Damage: 4d8+6, Speed: 99.</pre>
    Like the ratling guardians, the Ogre Guardian plays no real part in
    the game. He guards a prison in the High Mountain Village which
    holds a few monsters. The Ogre Guardian does not react if the PC
    opens the jail and kills the monsters within. If the Ogre Guardian
    becomes hostile, he is capable of throwing huge rocks at the PC.
    <p> <a name="2.1.6"></a></p>
    <h4>2.1.6 Gaab'Baay, the old crone <tt>@</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 45, PV: 28, Hits: 380, Attacks: 2, Damage: 2d24+16, Speed: 200.</pre>
    Gaab'Baay is an NPC found living in a hidden room in the eastern
    side of the High Mountain Village. Her name is an anagram for "Baba
    Yaga", a mythical Slavic witch. Gaab'Baay is of critical importance
    for those attempting a special ending. She assigns several quests;
    the reward is the Medal of Chaos, which is required to pass through
    the Chaos Gate. She will assign quests only to PCs with chaotic
    alignment - if the PC is lawful or neutral, she will just tell them
    to 'mature'. Furthermore, she will not assign quests until the
    Demented Ratling has been given six artifacts ("Talk to the mutated
    one."). Her quests are as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>Bring her the skull of a giant boar. An annoying quest. Giant
        boars can only be found randomly in the wilderness, and rarely
        leave skulls, even for PCs that have Food Preservation at 100.
        This quest can literally take months of game time to complete,
        causing elapsed game time to exceed the 90 day point at which
        time background corruption starts to accelerate. </li>
      <li>Bring a potion of cure corruption. These can be obtained from
        Guth'Alak (see section <a href="#0a311">0.10.3.1.1</a>). It is
        worth taking the time to get one from Guth'Alak, since they are
        very rare otherwise. </li>
      <li>Bring the corpse of a farmer. Quite often a farmer will be
        wandering around the outside of the High Mountain Village.
        Otherwise they can be found in Terinyo. It seems farmers leave a
        corpse more often after this quest is assigned, but the effect
        has not been quantitated. So if you are playing a wild chaotic,
        use some restraint and don't wipe out all farmers just because
        they are easy to kill. It might also be prudent to kill off the
        stone giant lord outside the HMV if one is generated. You don't
        want him killing off your farmer. </li>
      <li>Bring a scroll of danger. Another scarce item. If the PC finds
        one, it should be put somewhere safe until it is needed. </li>
      <li>Bring a wand of monster creation. Note that a cursed wand of
        monster creation will work, but one with zero charges left will
        not. </li>
    </ol>
    <p> After successfully delivering all of these items, Gaab'Baay
      produces the Medal of Chaos. Note that it, like all parts of the
      Chaos Trinity, corrupts the PC merely by carrying it. Leave it
      somewhere safe until it is needed.</p>
    <p> As an opponent, the old crone is very fast, has powerful poison
      attacks and is capable of attacking with powerful spells. There is
      generally never any reason to fight with her, anyway.</p>
    <p> <a name="2.1.7"></a></p>
    <h4>2.1.7 Oracle <tt>@</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 10, PV: 1, Hits: 30, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d8+3, Speed: 120.</pre>
    The Oracle is a strange being living in the middle of a pond in the
    High Mountain Village. She will reveal cryptic messages about the
    PC's future when <tt>C</tt>hatted with, and will explain how to
    achieve the Ordinary Chaos God ending to PCs with appropriate items.
    The most common use for the Oracle is to kill her for her corpse,
    which is a guaranteed drop, provides +6 increase to Learning. The
    corpse does curse and doom the PC, so it is strongly recommended
    that the PC have a favourable disposition with her deity before
    eating the Oracle.
    <p> The Oracle is a karmic being, so missile weapons are recommended
      to kill her. More importantly, the Oracle is capable of casting
      the Death Ray spell, which can instantly kill unprepared
      characters. Death rays can only be cast in the straight line,
      however, and the Oracle is incapable of walking on the water and
      leaving her position. As a consequence, she can be killed quite
      easily if the PC is not standing in direct line with her.</p>
    <p> Curiously, it appears companions will not attack the Oracle when
      ordered.</p>
    <p> <a name="2.1.8"></a></p>
    <h4>2.1.8 Malicious Doctor <tt>@</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 10, PV: 2, Hits: 27, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d3+1, Speed: 120.</pre>
    The Malicious Doctor has a flesh golem <tt>Y</tt> companion for
    sale for 25,000 gold pieces. He plays no other part in the game.
    From the reports of those who have acquired this companion, it is
    not worth the money. If the player wants this companion, it is worth
    luring the Malicious Doctor to the SMC before buying it. In that
    case it is generated with much more experience.
    <p> Note that the Malicious Doctor will not sell this companion to
      lawful PCs. When lawful PCs <tt>C</tt>hat with him, the game
      responds with "The malicious doctor eyes you with suspicion. "My
      office is closed."</p>
    <p> <a name="2.1.9"></a></p>
    <h4>2.1.9 Ratling traders <tt>r</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 16, PV: 0, Hits: 10, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d6+1, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Ratling traders are occasionally generated in the High Mountain
    Village. Like many other random monsters in the High Mountain
    Village, they are quite often hostile. If the PC needs food at this
    point, don't kill hostile ratling traders. They may eventually
    become nonhostile and therefore a source of food.
    <p> <a name="2.1.10"></a></p>
    <h4>2.1.10 Hidden locations</h4>
    There are three hidden locations in the High Mountain Village.
    Gaab'Baay is located in a hidden passageway along the eastern wall.
    Two scrolls are located in the doorless room in the center of the
    northern wall. The only way to enter this room is with
    teleportation. Note that teleportation traps may be conveniently
    generated adjacent to and within the room:
    <p> </p>
    <pre>  #######
  .#.?.#.
  .#^..#.
  .#####.
  ^......
</pre>
    The carets represent locations where a teleportation trap may be
    created. A teleportation trap can also be created on the square
    where the scrolls lie, of course.
    <p> The two scrolls are a cursed scroll of chaos resistance and a
      "strange message". See section <a href="#5.2">5.2</a> for the
      contents. The final location is a hidden passage in the western
      wall. It contains a potion of ultra healing and a staircase behind
      yet another hidden door. The staircase leads to the northern
      central part of the wilderness.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Infinite Dungeon</h3>
    The Infinite Dungeon is found in the southeastern part of the
    wilderness map. Prior to entering it, the description is "A tiny,
    strangely distorted cave entry."
    <p> The Infinite Dungeon (ID) is truly infinite for all practical
      purposes. The level number is limited by a signed 32 bit integer
      value, but who really cares about that? It would take many
      lifetimes to descend through all its levels, even assuming a PC
      could survive such a trip, which is impossible. The danger level
      increases with dungeon level; any level greater than 200 or so
      becomes ridiculous.</p>
    <p> The ID has some unique characteristics: shops, altars and pools
      are never generated. Every dungeon level is randomly generated, so
      leaving a level and reentering it results in a completely new
      dungeon level. There is one special level, the SIL, where MaLaKaI
      resides.</p>
    <p> According to the Mad Minstrel, the ID was originally a monument
      built by the powers of law. The incursion of Chaos into Ancardia
      has twisted it into its current condition.</p>
    <p> Any non-hostile mobs, including Filk, that you <i>lose</i> in
      the ID will re-appear later in the wilderness to meet up with you.</p>
    <p> <b>Stair-hopping</b> (thanks to gut for this section)</p>
    <p> Stair hopping is the process of repeatedly ascending and
      descending a single staircase in the ID, for the purpose of
      generating hoards of items in the continuously generated rooms.
      Items generated on the ID's floors will be of a danger level equal
      to 1/3 of the ID's dungeon level. That means only DL1 items will
      be generated on ID levels 1-5. On ID levels 6-8, DL2 items can be
      generated, and DL3 items can be generated on ID levels 9-11. This
      applies to dipping items into potions of raw chaos and exchange as
      well. This does not apply to guaranteed drops, like eternium gear
      from chaos warriors. Also, it seems that this does not always
      apply to monster generation either.</p>
    <p> Benefits of stair hopping include: An easy way to acquire
      spellbooks, as they are all DL1, and thus available even on ID
      levels 1-2. An easy way to acquire extra DV/PV points for the
      early game, as shields, hats, gauntlets, boots, etc... can
      sometimes have nice stats. An easy source of teleport control
      (actually the only guaranteed source of TP control in the game),
      as blink dogs can be found after ID 4 (sometimes earlier). An easy
      way to acquire potions and scrolls that can save a PC's life.</p>
    <p> <a name="2.2.1"></a></p>
    <h4>2.2.1 Filk, the quickling bard <tt>p</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 500, PV: 3, Hits: 58, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d4+9, Speed: 1500.</pre>
    Once the PC takes the quest to kill Filk from the Assassin Prince
    (more about this is found in section <a href="#4.3.1.1">4.3.1.1</a>),
Filk appears in the Infinite Dungeon on the level corresponding to the
    number of first-killed monsters killed. For example if the first
    monster killed was a rat and 225 rats have been killed, Filk will be
    found on I: 225. If the PC reaches the level Filk is on but leaves
    the ID without slaying him, he can found randomly in the wilderness;
    in which case the player will be asked if they wish for Filk to
    accompany the PC.
    <p> Filk shares the properties of karmics although he is not named
      as such. He is easiest killed with ball spells.</p>
    <p> When chatted to, Filk asks the PC to kill his arch enemy the Mad
      Minstrel. If the PC does so, though, Filk will not give any
      reward; he will just say "Meisaveryhappyquickling!" when chatted
      with. Since killing Filk for the Mad Minstrel opens the
      possibility of an Ultra ending, it would be very wise for the
      player to take the Mad Minstrel's side in this dispute.</p>
    <p> If the PC tries to wish for "quickling bard", lots of hostile
      quickling lords will be summoned instead.</p>
    <p> <a name="2.2.2"></a></p>
    <h4>2.2.2 MaLaKaI, the dwarven chaos knight <tt>h</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 79, DV: 70, PV: 30, Hits: 450, Attacks: 8, Damage: 4d6+32, Speed: 110.</pre>
    MaLaKaI resides in the SIL, found at level 66 of the ID. He guards
    the Sceptre of Chaos, a part of the Chaos Trinity.
    <p> </p>
    <pre>----------- Sceptre of Chaos (+8, 6d6+8) [-8, +0] {Ma+8} (+8 spd) ----------

Weight: 800s

When worn it modifies DV by -8 and PV by +0.

When used in melee combat it grants a +8 bonus to hit and causes 6d6+8
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and
causes 1d40+20 points of damage.

It modifies your mana attribute by +8.
It contains the essence of Chaos and Corruption.
It modifies your speed by +8.
It grants resistance to poison.
It grants bad luck.
Wearing it makes you doomed.
It grants resistance to shock attacks.
</pre>
    The SIL is not really part of the ID. It is discovered by descending
    through the ID normally, but once left, it can never be found again.
    This means if a PC needs the Sceptre of Chaos, there is only one
    chance to get it, so be prepared. MaLaKaI is quite tough. He has a
    corrupting melee attack and attacks 8 times per round. He cannot see
    in darkness and is vulnerable to humanoid and demon slaying weapons
    and ammo.
    <p> Conclusive proof that the SIL is not part of the ID is the fact
      that altars are sometimes generated in the SIL. These can come in
      very handy since MaLaKaI can be sacrificed.</p>

    <p> The Bug-Infested Temple consists of two parts: the bug
      wilderness (BUGWIL) and bug cave (BUGCAV). The wilderness part's
      outer limits are scattered with greater claw bugs, that low-level
      spellcasters can bolt to death (be very cautious!). Around the
      down staircase, there are eight killer bugs.</p>
    <p> Note that both greater claw bugs and killer bugs have high
      speed, breed, have multiple attacks and bypass the PC's PV. This
      means that they are what they're called - killers - in melee.
      Being surrounded by multiple killer bugs can easily prove to be
      fatal even to very well armored PCs in the late game.</p>
    <p> Eating a greater claw bug corpse increases speed, gives +3 Dx
      and -6 Wi. Eating a killer bug corpse also increases speed, gives
      +6 Dx and -12 Wi. The increases are no longer guaranteed in ADOM

    Teleportation doesn't work in BUGCAV, and

    <p> The Bug Temple has been beefed up considerably since 1.0.0 with
      the simple addition of the see invisible intrinsic for the bugs.
      Low (or even high) level spellcasters are no longer going to be
      able to finish this area easily.The rewards have been toned down:
      only three SoCRs, six PoUH, eight SoMM. The wand of fireballs has
      ten charges, the wand of teleportation has six charges.</p>

    <p> Note that some of the rewards' stats may vary and that they are
      all <i>cursed</i>. However, those potions of ultra healing,
      scrolls of magic mapping and especially the scrolls of chaos
      resistance are a gift that makes visiting the Bug Cave very
      worthwhile.</p>
    <p> There is one more statue, an "unfinished statue of an
      unquestionably famous hero" in honor of Raymond Martineau. No
      reward for breaking him down, though.</p>
    <p> Breaking the center statue and the statue ten squares west + one
      north stops the breeding of the bugs and results in an appropriate
      line in the accomplishment list at the end of the game.</p>

    <p> Darkforge is an important location in the game. It is not a
      location for low level PCs, unless they have on demand controlled
      teleportation, a willingness to risk an instadeath from a single
      hit from a steel golem, and are spoiled silly with a complete map.

    The entrance to Darkforge is described as "A long and non-descript
    tunnel." The first level of the dungeon is not particularly
    dangerous except for the presence of a steel golem guarding the down
    staircase. Steel golems are very tough monsters for a mid-level PC.
    If the PC has trouble with the steel golem guarding the down
    staircase, flee. There are many more guarding Darkforge itself. Upon
    entering Darkforge, the message "You smell the reek of sulphur,
    steel and oil." is generated. The steel golems that guard Darkforge
    are unlife and thus immune to Mindcraft. They are vulnerable to
    missiles of construct slaying, but it is almost unheard of to find
    enough such ammo to take them all out by this point in the game.
    They are vulnerable to lightning, from the spell or wand, although
    it will take many castings or charges to kill all of them. Steel
    golems will shrug off many lightning attacks, but can eventually be
    killed this way. They breathe fire, so both the PC and his equipment
    need to be protected from fire. Many players will attempt Darkforge
    just before assaulting the Tower of Eternal Flames, in order to
    determine whether their PC has a good chance in the ToEF.
    <p> The layout of the water squares in the pool room may help to
      keep golems or Kherab from attacking. If so, teleporting in and
      out is one way to attack them. Leaving the last group of golems
      near the Crown of Science alone will help to control monster
      generation in Darkforge. It has been observed that the steel
      horrors that are eventually generated tend to critically hit
      harder than the golems.</p>
    Due west of the starting position is a collection of pools, usually
    6-10 in number, the only guaranteed pools in the game (excepting a
    dangerous pool in the Stone Circle). Many players visit these pools
    in hopes of getting a wish or other valuable intrinsics. Further
    west of that is a large cache of armor. These pieces of armor can be
    of quite high quality, including dragon scale armor, eternium
    pieces, or occasionally artifacts. There is another cache of weapons
    in the south side of the map, featuring a number of weapons of
    similar quality. The treasure rooms themselves are accessed from
    trapped hallways connecting to central room complete with nine
    forges, and Kherab, the dwarven artificer. The west side of the map
    contains a small cache of gold, and a final set of steel golems
    guarding the shortcut to the Caverns of Chaos. These stairs allow
    the player quick access to D:32 or D:33, but must be ascended from
    the CoC side first before they can be used. A secret room in this
    same hallway also holds the Crown of science (the lone <tt>[</tt>),
    an artifact that provides a significant boost to Learning, as well
    as fire immunity, but is autocursing and dooms the wearer. The crown
    is surrounded by traps and has yet another steel golem on it.
    <p> </p>
    <pre>--------------------- crown of science [+4, +8] {Le+9} ---------------------

Weight: 65s

When worn it modifies DV by +4 and PV by +8.

When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d3 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d3
points of damage.

It modifies your learning attribute by +9.
It is a permanently cursed item.
It grants bad luck.
Wearing it makes you doomed.
It grants immunity to fire.
</pre>
    It is not wise to spend inordinate amounts of time in Darkforge -
    for example smithing. Darkforge has a higher than normal rate of
    background corruption.
    <p> Monsters who can be generated in Darkforge consist of the
      following: steel golem, steel horror, animated armor, steel
      zombie, dwarven chaos knight.</p>

    <p> <a name="2.4.1"></a></p>
    <h4>2.4.1 Kherab, the dwarven artificer <tt>h</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 25, PV: 35, Hits: 350, Attacks: 3, Damage: 4d7+19, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Kherab is presumably the creator of the steel golems, steel horrors
    and animated armors found in Darkforge. He is quite tough, with
    hitpoints numbering in the hundreds and a powerful melee attack. He
    is immune to fire, sees in Darkness, shrugs bolt spells quite well
    and has very fast regeneration. He is vulnerable to poison. He holds
    two items necessary for Smithing: a hammer (an eternium warhammer)
    and an anvil. He also carries a crossbow and eternium quarrels. He
    is the source of two quests outlined below.
    <p> <a name="2.4.2"></a></p>
    <h4>2.4.2 Kherab's quests and their rewards</h4>
    Kherab is the source of two chaotic quests. The first is to kill
    Guth'Alak, the druid found in Terinyo. This of course removes
    Guth'Alak as a source of potions of cure corruption and as the
    source of the Unicorn quest. Depending on how it is accomplished,
    the entire village of Terinyo may become hostile as well. If this
    happens, it may destroy any chance the PC has to obtain the TotRR.
    The reward for this quest is the corrupting artifact shield of raw
    steel.
    <pre>---------------- shield of raw steel (+2) [+18, +12] {To+8} ----------------

Weight: 180s

When worn it modifies DV by +18 and PV by +12.

When used in melee combat it grants a +2 bonus to hit and causes 1d6 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d6
points of damage.

It modifies your toughness attribute by +8.
It contains the essence of Chaos and Corruption.
It grants resistance to poison.
It grants immunity to fire.
It grants immunity to cold attacks.
</pre>
    The second quest is to kill Thrundarr, the village elder in
    Dwarftown. This can have all sorts of negative effects as well,
    including turning all of Dwarftown hostile and the killing of the
    Demented Ratling. The reward for this quest is the corrupting amulet
    of raw steel.
    <pre>------------------- amulet of raw steel [+3, +3] {Pe+12} -------------------

Weight: 10s

When worn it modifies DV by +3 and PV by +3.

When used in melee combat it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d3 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d3
points of damage.

It modifies your perception attribute by +12.
It contains the essence of Chaos and Corruption.
It grants resistance to sleep attacks.
It grants resistance to stunning.
It grants resistance to death attacks.
It grants the ability to see invisible things.
</pre>
    The quest rewards are useful only because they are artifacts. They
    can be fed to the Demented Ratling, for instance. The shield is the
    best in the game at [+18, +12] and To +8, but it cannot be used for
    the whole game due to its corrupting nature. However, it also grants
    fire immunity, so it is an option for PCs that need its properties
    to help with the ToEF. These "rewards" are not really rewards.
    Kherab is an evil chaotic being and wants the PC dead. Giving away
    corrupting artifacts is his way of trying to accomplish this.

    The left side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is
    disconnected. Entry must be made by digging. Teleportation is not
    allowed on the level. Note the underscore in the center of the
    temple. This is the chaotic elemental altar where the orb guardian
    is found (at least until it is disturbed and moves). The elemental
    altars are very dangerous. The temples are populated by sentient
    beings who will sacrifice the PC instantly should he step on it. In
    addition, they can only be converted by champions of Balance or
    Order, which means PCs going for an ultra ending cannot convert them
    early in the game, before retrieving the Medal of Chaos.

    PCs are denied entrance to the lower CoC until they have the Chaos
    Orb of Elemental Fire, held by the Ancient Chaos Wyrm in the ToEF,
    and the game stalls at this point. PCs can continue to gain
    experience levels by staying on available cavernous levels (for
    instance) in order to have a better chance in the Tower. Ultimately,
    however, boredom will set in and the PC will have to face the Tower.
    Obtaining the Fire Orb is a huge hurdle to get over and marks a
    division between the earlier, beginning parts of the game and the
    latter parts of the game. Some players also believe it marks the
    division between beginning and advanced players.
    <p> The Tower of Eternal Flames consists of four levels. They are
      all very, very hot. This causes damage to both the PC and his
      equipment, whether worn or in the pack. To protect the PC, fire
      resistance or immunity is necessary. See section <a
        href="#0.12.1.1">0.12.1.1</a> about fire resistance.</p>
    <p> To protect the PC (other than Drakelings, see below) completely
      from the heat in the ToEF, the PC must have four sources of fire
      resistance. Note that intrinsic fire resistance counts as two
      sources. Thus, for example, a PC with intrinsic fire resistance
      wearing a ring of fire resistance under the elemental gauntlets
      would take no damage from the heat in the Tower.</p>
    <p> The fire damage PC takes if the following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>no fire resistance - 10 dmg per turn </li>
      <li>1 source - 2 dmg per turn </li>
      <li>2 sources - 1 dmg per turn </li>
      <li>3 sources - 1 dmg per 2 turns </li>
      <li>4+ sources - no damage </li>
    </ul>
    <p> If the player has the Immune to Pain talent, two resistances are
      enough.</p>
    <p> There are a number of artifacts that grant fire resistance or
      immunity. Guaranteed examples include the elemental gauntlets, the
      black torc (curses), the Ring of the High Kings (all grant
      resistance), the Shield of Raw Steel (immunity, but corrupts) and
      the Crown of Science (immunity, but also dooms and curses). There
      is a game bug which causes fireproof blankets to be positively
      affected by the cursed and doomed intrinsics; they seem to last
      indefinitely in the Tower. Assaulting the Tower with these
      intrinsics is a dangerous choice, of course. It is difficult
      enough without them. There are several other nonguaranteed
      artifacts which grant resistance or immunity to fire. It is worth
      remembering that artifacts are indestructible and so cannot be
      damaged by the heat in the Tower.</p>
    <p> Drakelings face special problems in the ToEF. The Mad Minstrel
      sings a song about this. Drakelings, even those with fire
      immunity, always take damage in the ToEF. This is not because of
      the heat itself but is a secondary effect due to the greatly
      increased metabolism Drakelings will suffer from in the ToEF.
      There is no way around it. In order to survive, Drakelings must
      have a means of regeneration or healing in the ToEF. Ideally an
      artifact that causes regeneration should be worn. An alternative
      is to bring blessed potions of extra healing along. It is possible
      for Drakelings to do the ToEF with only three or four blessed PoEH
      if everything is done efficiently with no wasted time.</p>
    <p> One technique Drakelings (and other races for that matter) can
      use is to read a blessed scroll of magic mapping upon entering a
      new level of the ToEF followed by teleportation to the up
      stairway. Obviously the PC must have the necessary scrolls, wands
      or spell and teleport control.</p>
    <p> The heat in the tower will destroy equipment that is vulnerable
      to fire. This includes most items that are not made of the higher
      metals mithril, adamantium and eternium. Rings of fire resistance
      will not be damaged. Weapons and armor with the red prefix are
      also impervious to heat.</p>
    <p> If a PC must wear items vulnerable to fire, a blessed ring of
      ice is necessary. Uncursed rings of ice will not work, they must
      be blessed. Even with a blessed ring of ice, some equipment
      destruction may occur. Blessed rings of ice seem to protect to the
      92-95% level. Even wearing two blessed rings of ice does not
      guarantee worn equipment will not be destroyed, although the
      protection seems to go up to 99+%. A ring of ice is of course not
      necessary if the PC wears only artifacts and items made of the
      higher metals. Missiles are an obvious problem. It is rare to find
      enough arrows made from higher metals to satisfy an archer in the
      ToEF, for instance. Even rocks are vulnerable to the heat,
      sometimes exploding. Non-artifact slings, bows and crossbows are
      liable to be burnt or melted.</p>
    <p> This whole situation is very vexing, because the ToEF contains a
      very nasty collection of monsters and the PC naturally wants to
      bring his best equipment with him, but at the same time does not
      want it destroyed.</p>
    <p> One thing to remember - rings are never destroyed until the
      gauntlets worn over them are destroyed. Since the artifact
      elemental gauntlets are available to all PCs, this provides a
      foolproof means of protecting nonartifact rings.</p>
    <p> The objective in the ToEF is of course the Chaos Orb of
      Elemental Fire. It is held by the Ancient Chaos Wyrm who can be
      found on the top level of the ToEF. This level is typical of the
      levels containing elemental temples. The temple itself occupies
      half of the level and is disconnected. It can only be reached by
      digging. Teleportation is not allowed on the level. Since a PC may
      have his only means of digging destroyed on his way through the
      tower, praying on the top level will result in a pickaxe gift from
      the PC's god. The piety level required is 15000 piety. The PC must
      not be doomed or cursed. If he is using artifacts that grant those
      intrinsics, remove them.</p>
    <p> The temple itself is occupied by problematic monsters. These
      include fire elementals, chaos servants, fire grues, fire drakes
      and fire demons in addition to the orb guardian. The fire demons
      and fire grues in particular are annoying because they have a
      corrupting melee attack with a very high to-hit. Even PCs with
      excellent DV will be hit eventually. Taken as a whole, this means
      that invisibility is very, very desirable in the Fire Temple.</p>
    <p> The only temple monsters that see in Darkness are fire demons
      and the Ancient Chaos Wyrm. It is most useful for fighting the
      elementals. It is probably wise to dispel the Darkness before
      tackling the ACW.</p>
    <p> Monsters (except possible vaults) who can be generated in the
      ToEF consist of the following: fire beetle, fire lizard (double
      chance), fire drake (thrice chance), fire giant (thrice chance),
      red baby dragon, red dragon, fire demon, fire grue, fire
      elemental, red worm (double chance), fire giant, fire giant king.</p>
    <p> <a name="2.5.1"></a></p>
    <h4>2.5.1 Ancient Chaos Wyrm <tt>W</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 50, PV: 20, Hits: 410, Attacks: 3, Damage: 6d12+9, Speed: 130.</pre>
    The Ancient Chaos Wyrm holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire, the
    key to the lower parts of the CoC. It has a fire breath attack and a
    corrupting melee attack. In addition it is able to cast confusion
    and an energy ray. It is able to heal its wounds. The ACW can be
    killed in a variety of ways including brute force, although it is
    preferable to attack it from a distance due to its corrupting melee
    attack. The ACW is vulnerable to dragon slaying ammo. If it is
    killed on the temple's altar, be extraordinarily careful! If the PC
    is visible the fire demons will sacrifice him instantly. Even if the
    PC is invisible, fire demons who have been engaged in melee will
    "know" where the PC is and sacrifice him. The safest thing to do is
    <tt>k</tt>ick anything dropped on the altar to an adjacent square
    before picking it up. The elemental altars can only be converted by
    champions of Balance or Order, which means PCs going for an ultra
    ending cannot convert them early in the game, before retrieving the
    Medal of Chaos.
    <pre>-------------------- Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire {St+10} -------------------

It is an artifact.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 2d9+3
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and
causes 1d10+3 points of damage.

It modifies your strength attribute by +10.

    <p> A geographical exploit makes the Old Barbarian's Glade the ideal
      place to wish for an Emperor Moloch (which instead results in 25
      or so Greater Molochs) for those PCs that are desperate for
      experience. The greater molochs should be summoned on the far
      right side of the map, so they will appear bunched together there.
      A quick teleport, and strategic use of frost bolt will yield a
      perfectly safe ice island from which the PC can snipe his way to
      experience level 50 with ease.</p>
    <p> Note that the Old Barbarian's Glade is a decent place to store
      items. He is the only monster ever generated in this location, so
      nothing randomly generated is going to run away with the PC's
      stuff. If the PC leaves items far away from the Old Barbarian (or
      if he is dead), he will not have time to find them prior to the
      PC's next visit.</p>

    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 12, PV: 12, Hits: 500, Attacks: 2, Damage: 1d10+10, Speed: 130.</pre>
    The Old Barbarian assigns a quest to kill a score (20) of the
    monsters the PC first killed. As a reward for successfully
    completing the quest he teaches the Courage skill. The quest is only
    available to non-chaotics and is not available until the PC has
    killed 500 monsters. He monitors the progress towards completing it
    - his feedback can be used by the player to help them remember the
    PC's first kill - when chatted to during his quest he will either
    remark that the PC is showing promise if they have killed at least
    one more of their first kill, or remark that the PC is lazy if they
    haven't. Note that if the PC somehow acquires the Courage skill
    after the quest is assigned but before it is completed (Bard's class
    power, potion of education), returns to the Old Barbarian and <tt>C</tt>hats
    with him, he is surprised and gives the PC an ordinary two-handed
    sword.
    <p> For more about strategy for the first kill, see section <a
        "#0.9.1"="">0.9.1</a>.</p>
    <p> If the player does not care about the Courage skill, the Old
      Barbarian can be a source of early game experience since he can be
      attacked from behind water squares. There is a demo of this. This
      led to more problems than it solved for the demo player, because
      experience level 14 was reached very quickly without the time to
      find equipment that was appropriate for the level.</p>

    <h3>2.7 Dwarven Graveyard</h3>
    <p> The Dwarven Graveyard is located in the southeastern mountains
      of the wilderness map. It cannot be found until the PC talks to
      Thrundarr about <tt>portal</tt>. The portal seals the lower parts
      of the CoC until the PC finishes this quest or removes Thrundarr
      from his location in Dwarftown and <tt>h</tt>andles the lever
      controlling the portal. It is most definitely worth doing the
      quest, since two artifacts can be found in the graveyard.</p>
    <p> There have been conflicting reports about the rewards Thrundarr
      provides for accomplishing this quest. It is always equipment,
      though the status varies. Whether holy water is poured on Griff's
      grave seems to make little difference in this preliminary
      examination:</p>
    <p> Griff destroyed in melee, no holy water poured on grave: </p>
    <pre>uncursed wand of digging (0 charges)
uncursed wand of fireballs (1 charge)
heap of 6 blessed potions of extra healing
</pre>
    a different PC, same scenario:
    <pre>uncursed wand of digging (5 charges)
uncursed wand of fireballs (1 charge)
heap of 3 blessed potions of extra healing
</pre>
    Griff destroyed in melee, poured holy water on grave afterwards:

    The surface level of the graveyard is an open plain inhabited by
    many, many undead. There are skeletons, zombies, ghuls, shadows and
    wights present. This is also probably the first time the player
    finds graves. See section <a href="#0df">0.13.15</a> for more about
    graves and gravedigging. It is probably not worth trying to dig up
    the "great treasures" graves with a level 13-17 PC. The PC can
    always return later if desired.
    <p> If the PC has a limited supply of undead slaying ammo use it
      very sparingly, if at all. It will be needed in the underground
      level.</p>
    <p> The center of the plain contains a small building that leads to
      the underground level.</p>

    The underground level of the dwarven graveyard contains a labyrinth
    which features many traps. It is very wise to have the Detect Traps
    skill while navigating this maze. Use the <tt>s</tt>earch command
    constantly if the PC has the Detect Traps skill. The left side of
    the screen is the problematic area regarding traps. The right side
    of the screen is Griff's tomb, which has been taken over by Nonnak,
    the master necromancer. It contains a large number of undead,
    including ghosts, wraiths, Griff Bloodax the undead dwarven chaos
    berserker and Nonnak himself.
    <p> There are two artifacts hidden in Nonnak's lair. The Elemental
      Gauntlets are found in a hidden room in the center of the eastern
      wall. They are guarded by a bone golem <tt>Y</tt> and are almost
      always located on a trap. The bone golem is not difficult to
      defeat for a PC that has made it through the Dwarven Graveyard. </p>

    The Sword of Nonnak is located in Griff Bloodax's grave in the
    center of Nonnak's lair. It is necessary to have some means of
    digging to retrieve it. The sword is quite important for Wizards,
    Mindcrafters and other classes dependent upon Willpower. It grants
    +5 to Willpower. Only Dwarves are able to understand the inscription
    on the Griff's grave (<i>"Griff Bloodax, mighty dwarven warrior, is
      buried here."</i>). Note that digging up Griff's grave to retrieve
    the sword is a chaotic act, like any grave digging.

    Griff Bloodax is a brute force opponent. He does not seem to have
    any special attacks, though his melee attack is formidable for a
    level 13 PC. Note that Griff is teleportation resistant. Therefore
    simply trying to teleport him away in order to reach his grave and <tt>U</tt>se
    holy water will not work. Using undead slaying ammo is very
    effective against him, while melee with a low-teens experience level
    PC may be difficult.

    Nonnak created the undead guarding the tomb. He is vulnerable to
    fire-based attacks. He uses Frost Bolt as an offensive spell and
    regenerates health. PCs without cold resistance will have a very
    hard time defeating him. He is also a summoner. Note that both Griff
    Bloodax and Nonnak must be dead to fulfill Thrundarr's quest.

    <pre>Level 1, DV 70, PV 0, Hits 120, Attacks 5, Damage 1d6+16, Speed 140.</pre>
    The Mad Minstrel lives in a hut. As he wanders about, he will
    randomly drop corpses that correspond to the danger level of the
    level he is on. In his own clearing, he drops mainly goblin, orc,
    and bat corpses. If one leads him a few steps over to the
    bug-infested temple, he will drop plenty of dragon and giant
    corpses. Pretty safe, but at least one greater bug will have to be
    killed first. That's not difficult though, as any offensive wand
    will work nicely. To get the Mad Minstrel out of his glade, order a
    companion to attack him when he is close to the map border. The PC
    can then switch places with the pet, and the Mad Minstrel will come
    to stand on the border. Careful with pet type though, as if it's too

    <h4>2.8.2 Mad Minstrel's songs</h4>
    The Mad Minstrel will sing songs which are somewhat cryptic hints
    about important parts of the game. If a player wants to finish the
    game without reading extensive spoilers, it is very important to sit
    through his concerts until the player has memorized everything he
    has to say. Alternatively, they are reproduced here along with [some
    interpretation]:

    <pre>The Song of the Mad Minstrel

"I am the thorn in the foot, I am the blur in the sight;
I am the worm at the root, I am the thief in the night.
I am the rat in the wall, the leper that leers at the gate;
I am the ghost in the hall, herald of horror and hate.

I am the rust on the corn, I am the smut on the wheat,
Laughing man's labor to scorn, weaving a web for his feet.
I am canker and mildew and blight, danger and death and decay;
The rot of the rain by night, the blast of the sun by day.

I warp and wither with drouth, I work in the swamp's foul yeast;
I bring the black plague from the south and the leprosy in from the east.
I rend from the hemlock boughs wine steeped in the petals of dooms;
Where the fat black serpents drowse I gather the Upas blooms.

I have plumbed the northern ice for a spell like Frozen lead;
In lost grey fields of rice, I have learned from Mongol dead.
Where a bleak black mountain stands I have looted grisly caves;
I have digged in the desert sands to plunder terrible graves.

Never the sun goes forth, never the moon glows red,
But out of the south or the north, I come with the slavering dead.
I come with hideous spells, black chants and ghastly tunes;
I have looted the hideen hells amd plundered the lost black moons.

There was never a king or priest to cheer me by word or look,
There was never a man or beast in the blood-black ways I took.
There were crimson gulfs unplumbed, there were black wings over a sea,
There were pits where mad things drummed, and foaming blasphemy.

There were vast ungodly tombs where slimy monsters dreamed;
There were clouds like blood-drenched plumes where unborn demons screamed.
There were ages dead to Time, and lands lost out of Space;
There were adders in the slime, and a dim unholy Face.

Oh, the heart in my breast turned stone, and the brain froze in my skull --
But I won through, I alone, and poured my chalice full
Of horrors and dooms and spells, black buds and bitter roots --
From the hells beneath the hells, I bring you my deathly fruits."

[This currently has some display errors, as anyone who spends time talking
to MM will know - a bug report has already been made. This is actually a
poem written by Robert E Howard (more well-known as the creator of the story
of Conan) - someone suggested it be included in an RFE a while back.]


    "Deep in the forest of moving trees,
        Crossing is not such a breeze,
   It may take some time, but be persistent,
        Even if some may be resistant,
     But whatever you do, don't use fire!
Or else you'll be faced with even hotter ire..."

[warning about the Animated Forest, section <a href="#3.6">3.6</a>]


 "The Lord of the Cats is a touchy fellow,
His teeth are sharp and his eyes are yellow.
  All kinds of cats he calls his subjects,
  Small ones, big ones, all he'll protect.
       If kind ye be to cats, I sing,
      Talk from him his precious ring!"

[reference to the Cat Lord and felines; see section <a href="#0.9.2">0.9.2</a>]


    "Felines have a shiny fur.
When you feed them, they will purr.
  True cat-lovers never harm them,
 some musicians try to charm them.
 For all others, let me warn them:
  As soon as felines meet disaster
 their energy rejoins their master."

[more reference to the Cat Lord and felines]


    "Heaven help you in the tower of hell,
The elements will surely sound your death-knell,
 If walking on fire still shrouds you in pain,
  You might just need some more of the same..."

[Tower of Eternal Flames; be prepared warning, section <a href="#2.5">2.5</a>]


      "In a very hot tower
  your points in life get lower.
Resisting fire not once but twice
       Would be very wise."

[Tower of Eternal Flames; have two fire resistance
  sources beyond the intrinsic, which counts as two]


       "A drakelings scales may be crimson red
       if a creature of fire for dinner he had
    he may wear tough scales and two rings to boot
      he may have the armour and all of the loot
          but fire is still a hazard to him
  cause a drakeling will start to burn from within.

     He will become fast, even fast as the light
  his foes may run screaming at this unearthly sight
      as quicklings so fast, he may just become
      but the hazard of fire will never be gone
  cause the speed makes him dizzy and dazy and that
  and no ring and no scales will save him from that.

      So the tower of fire is a dangerous thing
and you should really listen to the sound of my string
   for a drakeling has really a hard time in there
   without healing and stuff he won't get anywhere.
      So a potion or herb might be a good boon,
 but if you enter without them - you are just a loon!"

[warning about the special problems Drakelings have in the ToEF]


       "Fire - fierce and full of vigour
        Earth - tough with age old rigour
        Water - possessing strength within
        Air - so agile it'll make you spin

        These Four combine to make all life,
But when there is imbalance it brings great strife,
       For their product, Mana, will fluctuate,
          And Chaos floods out from the Gate.

          Five keys you need to open the way,
       And then from your path you may not stray,
     You can only proceed, there is no turning back,
    So be sure you are ready for the final attack..."

[hint about the orbs - currently split into 3 seperate songs,
but should be all one]


"The Banshee sings a strangely compelling song,
      No one can listen to it for long.
              You better beware
                And take care.
           Beware is what you need,
     Understand this verb and take heed."

   "A small cave for beginners
   The big ones are for winners

And strange monsters will be found."

      "The trinity is very tough to find
                in case you mind.
           three parts you will need,
          lots of blood you will shed.
            Once all are collected,
      once your deceitful fame is erected,
   once in servitude you seem to be joining,
once chaos powers the word "friend" are coining,
            you'll enter the gate...
        Quickly - before it's too late!"

            "I'm so lazy,
         My knowledge's hazy,
         My sounds are loud,
         but rarely I shout.
        My lyrics are coarse,

       "An age ago, there lived a king, most pious and benevolent,
  Who from his god received a ring to shield him from the elements.
      This king, he had a brother true, a fighter lion-hearted,
Who sought to rout all Chaos through the Gate from whence it started.
   He purged the evil from the land, his blade once never faltered,
       And only by his god's own hand was his adventure halted.
  "O fighter brave," his god did say, "though noble is your mission,
       Yet centuries must slip away before it finds completion.
     The Balance leans too much to Law, and I must now amend it;
    Let Chaos have its time on Earth ere back to hell you send it.
    But watch this stair eternally, and wait for Heaven's message,
    To show the mighty champion who's earned the right of passage.
    For only one you'll step aside and cease your faithful vigil:
 The one who wears your brother's ring emblazed with Heaven's sigil.""

    <h3>2.9 Pyramid</h3>

    <p> The Pyramid is located in the wilderness, slightly east of the
      exact center of the map. It can be entered once the PC reaches
      experience level 13. When this happens, the game generates a
      message: "You suddenly feel ancient magical energies manifest in
      your vicinity." Searching the current location will reveal the
      papyrus scroll, which is an invitation to enter the Pyramid. Note
      the papyrus scroll will not appear in the Animated Forest. It is
      not necessary to read, or even find, the scroll for admission to
      the Pyramid. It asks the PC to come as soon as possible. Do not be
      fooled by this. It is best to wait as long as possible before
      entering the Pyramid, since it is a rather nasty place. The
      entrance to the Pyramid closes permanently if the PC reaches
      experience level 17. Ideally the PC should reach experience level
      16 and keep very careful track of his experience points. Approach
      the Pyramid when the PC is close to achieving level 17, within a
      couple hundred points. Wander around in the vicinity of the
      Pyramid to generate wilderness encounters. Killing monsters in the
      wilderness should enable the player to fine-tune his experience
      score to the point where very few additional points are needed to
      achieve level 17. Then enter the Pyramid. The first couple of
      kills in the Pyramid will raise the PC to experience level 17,
      maximizing the chances of success in the Pyramid. Keep a <i>very</i>
      close eye on those experience points. You don't want to
      accidentally achieve level 17 and have the Pyramid close, because
      Rehetep carries two artifacts.</p>
    <p> Once the PC has killed Rehetep, the Pyramid remains open
      permanently. The fact that it closes at PC experience level 17 if
      Rehetep remains alive is a potential game-breaker. If the PC drops
      a Chaos Orb in the Pyramid, then achieves experience level 17
      outside without killing Rehetep, the game is over. Since the Chaos
      Orb is inside an inaccessible location, it will never be possible
      to open the passage to D:49. Note this same scenario can occur
      with the Ruined City (Minotaur Maze, section <a href="#2.14"
       >2.14</a>).</p>

    The hashtag <tt >#</tt> is used to indicate the presence of a secret

    a number of non-guaranteed traps present. The location of the
    non-guaranteed traps changes from game to game. Also note the tools
    represented by the <tt>(</tt> symbol. This cache of tools is
    guaranteed and includes thieves' picks, a climbing set and a
    pickaxe. The tools are always located on top of a trap.
    <p> The inhabitants of this level include (greater) mummies, ghosts,
      spectres, jackal demons, jackalweres, jackals and hyenas. Mummies
      can cause sickness. It is very unwise to enter the Pyramid without
      some means of dealing with sickness. The fastest and easiest way
      to cure sickness is with blessed or uncursed curaria mancox herbs.</p>

    There is a unique feature on this level. The down staircase,
    represented by the <tt>&gt;</tt> symbol, changes location randomly
    once when the PC enters the level (unless the PC is wearing ankh).
    This forces the PC to fight his way to the new location if a retreat
    is necessary. Furthermore, the monsters on the level will not follow
    the PC down the stairs. In older gammas of ADOM, it was possible to
    lure the monsters down the stairs one at a time and dispatch them.
    It doesn't work in current versions of the game.
    <p> The <tt>Z</tt> at the top represents Rehetep, the Mummy Lord.
      The remaining <tt>Z</tt>s are mummies. The <tt>&amp;</tt>
      characters are jackal demons, which have a confusion attatck. The
      <tt>@</tt> characters represent a random monster, generally
      somewhat out of depth, but not terribly so. Bear in mind that
      mummies see invisible. If the PC is fortunate enough to have a
      means of invisibility at this point, use it and take out the
      mummies first.</p>

Jackal demon: Level: 1, DV: 18, PV: 4, Hits: 70, Attacks: 3, Damage: 2d6+4, Speed 100.</pre>
    If the PC has a means of controlled on demand teleportation, the
    fight becomes simpler. Rehetep normally recites a speech as soon as
    the PC moves, waking all the other monsters on the level. In ADOM
    1.1.1, if the PC teleports adjacent to Rehetep on arrival, he does
    not speak and the PC only has to fight Rehetep and the two jackal
    demons nearest to him.

    Rehetep sees invisible and in darkness, is immune to cold, death
    rays, and paralysis. His attacks may cause sickness, and he is
    highly vulnerable to fire. Rehetep holds two powerful artifacts, the
    Ankh and the Ancient Mummy Wrapping. A Greater Identify of each is provided below.

    <pre><b>Rehetep's artifacts</b>

------------------ ancient mummy wrapping [+1, +5] {Ap-8} ------------------

Weight: 60s

When worn it modifies DV by +1 and PV by +5.

    <br>

    Note that the [+2, +2] nature of the Ankh is not revealed explicitly
    except when Greater Identified. Note also that it not only grants
    the Lucky and Fate smiles intrinsics, but also increases luck, a
    hidden property used by the game when calculating dice rolls, etc.
    <p> The artifact Ancient Mummy Wrapping is the only mummy wrapping
      that weighs 60 stones. Be sure not to confuse it with other mummy
      wrappings. They are all described as a "strange wrapping" prior to
      identification. The resistances granted by the Ancient Mummy
      Wrapping are considerable and should give clues about how to
      attack Rehetep. Using cold based attacks is, of course, useless.
      Rehetep and other mummies are vulnerable to fire. This is where
      the wand of fireballs available from Thrundarr as a quest reward
      comes in very handy. Do not give up when messages about Rehetep
      "shrugging off" fire based attacks are generated. He will succumb
      to repeated fire attacks. All mummies including Rehetep are
      vulnerable to undead slaying ammo, of course.</p>
    <p> Note that the combination of cold immunity and the see invisible
      intrinsic available from the Ancient Mummy Wrapping makes
      Li-Hon-Kay, a potential 20th Arena fight opponent, much easier to
      defeat.</p>

    <h3>2.10 Gremlin Cave</h3>
    <pre>Gremlin: Level: 1, DV: 18, PV: 0, Hits: 8, Attacks: 2, Damage: 1d3+1, Speed 100.</pre>
    The Gremlin Cave is located in the southwest corner of the Drakalor
    Chain. There are messages generated when the PC enters the Gremlin
    Cave: "You feel watched. You shiver. You shiver really bad! It's
    dark here!". The Gremlin Cave is dark and filled with water traps,
    which, when triggered by the gremlins <tt>I</tt>, cause them to
    multiply. Things can get out of control quickly in this cave due to
    the rapid replication of the gremlins. The Disarm Traps spell or
    skill can be very valuable here - if the traps are taken out, the
    gremlin hordes can be dealt with eventually. The cave contains the
    Phial of Caladriel, which is an artifact potion.
    <pre>---------------------------- phial of Caladriel ----------------------------

Weight: 2s

When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d2 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d2
points of damage.

(the phial of Caladriel uses up the PC's power points to generate light,
and blinds monsters when thrown except undead and constructs)
</pre>
    The cave is also a source of fluff balls, which turn into gremlins
    when exposed to water, and a climbing set. The objective is to
    retrieve the Phial of Caladriel and optionally the climbing set.
    There is another guaranteed climbing set in the Pyramid (section <a
      "#2.9"="">2.9</a>). The Phial is located in the farthest possible
    corner from the entrance.
    <p> The cave is dark and gremlins are damaged by the Light spell,
      wands of light, scrolls of light, crystals of light or by using
      the phial. An amulet of light, a torch, adequate castings of the
      Light spell or many wands of light are necessary simply to see and
      navigate the cave. If the PC is fairly buff, the Gremlin Cave can
      be used to train weapon skills, since a potentially infinite
      number of gremlins will be generated. The gremlins will eventually
      become too experienced to contend with.</p>
    <p> Since there are a potentially endless number of gremlins
      available, it is also possible to use the Pick Pockets skill
      indefinitely. This will both train the skill and satisfy Yergius
      regarding the PC's proficiency as a thief. Bear in mind also the
      always-present possibilty of pickpocketing a truly outstanding
      item. While it is very rare, artifacts have been pickpocketed this
      way.</p>
    <p> The fluff balls found here are portable "gremlin bombs" which
      have received a lot of attention because of the possibility of
      pickpocketing indefinitely. On exposure to water, they turn into a
      gremlin, which then multiplies from the same water source.
      Bringing them underwater is interesting. ;-)</p>
    <p> Note that it is in no way necessary to enter this cave to
      complete the game. It is simply a source of an expendable artifact
      which can be sacrificed, given to the Demented Ratling or sold.
      The climbing set is also useful of course, especially if the PC
      has missed the opportunity to enter the Pyramid.</p>

    <h3>2.11 Assassins' Guild</h3>
    The Assassins' Guild is located in the wilderness, west of the river
    that divides the Drakalor Chain. The entrance is described as "A
    rather boring cave entrance." It consists of three levels.
    <p> <a name="2.11.1"></a></p>
    <h4>2.11.1 DDL</h4>
    The first level is named the DDL and contains no unique special
    features, although it may contain any of the normal dungeon
    features: traps, herbs, rivers, etc.
    <p> <a name="2.11.2"></a></p>
    <h4>2.11.2 VDDL</h4>
    Upon entering the second level, the message "This dungeon is very
    dusty." is generated. This level contains many, many teleportation
    traps and can be annoying without teleport control. It also contains
    one guaranteed item: a wand of teleportation <tt>\</tt>. The wand
    is always next to the down staircase found on the level in a 1 x 2
    room that is separated from the rest of the level. It can only be
    reached by digging or teleportation. In practice, the easiest way to
    find the down staircase is to zap a wand of item detection, or read
    a scroll of item detection. This will reveal the location of the
    wand, which the PC can then dig or teleport to, thus revealing the
    staircase. Alternatively a scroll of magic mapping will reveal the
    location of the down staircase. Note that it is possible for a
    monster to be standing on the wand, so teleportation may fail. Lucky
    or persistent players may even be able to teleport to the wand with
    a random teleport.
    <p> <a name="2.11.2.1"></a></p>
    <h4>2.11.2.1 Hidden stairway and how to descend</h4>
    The hidden down staircase in the VDDL is like no other in the game.
    It is itself a teleportation trap and will attempt to teleport the
    PC away when he tries to descend. Needless to say, this is extremely
    frustrating without teleport control. There is a requirement to
    trigger a certain number of teleportation traps on the level before
    the PC can descend. This can be done with either the normal
    teleportation traps or the staircase itself. However, it is much
    more efficient to use teleportation traps that are far away from the
    down staircase. They are up to six times faster at increasing the
    count of unsuccessful attempts. Just keep trying until the PC
    receives the message "You suddenly feel attuned to this area in a
    very special way." It is then possible to descend. It requires 42
    teleports of the far teleportation traps, or 250 teleports using the
    stairs.

    <p> The final level of the Assassins' Guild has no proper name; it
      is only named with four question marks: "????". There are definite
      precautions necessary on this level. The PC initially descends
      into a 3 x 3 room containing four assassins. The assassins are not
      particularly dangerous opponents, although they use poison. There
      is a safe passage available through the level which is free of
      traps, otherwise the level is full of traps. The PC <i>must not</i>
      use missile weapons on the level. If he does, a general alarm is
      sounded and the Assassin Prince, who is very important to the

      in the game. Likewise, a failed pickpocket attempt, or attempting
      to pickpocket the same assassin twice, will raise the general
      alarm. Also be careful during the melee. If an assassin panics,
      leave him alone. Attacking panic-stricken assassins will also make
      the Assassin Prince hostile. In their panicked state, they may
      begin attacking each other or the Assassin Prince himself. Pay no
      attention to them. The level contains assassins, master assassins,
      holy slayers, gray slayers, muggers, dopplegangers and
      doppleganger lords.</p>

    The Assassin Prince is the source of the Filk Quest, on behalf of
    the Mad Minstrel. This quest is only necessary for the Ultra
    endings. See section <a href="#4.3.1.1">4.3.1.1</a> for a
    description of this quest and its requirements. If a PC is not
    planning to do an Ultra ending, it may be worth killing the Assassin
    Prince for the artifact dagger Sting, which he carries. Note two
    things: the Assassin Prince has been described as the offspring of a
    moloch and a quickling queen - he's not quite that bad, but he is a
    very difficult opponent that uses poison - and second, Sting is
    really only worth acquiring if the PC has or plans to obtain its
    companion dagger Needle, available from Sharad-Waador (see section <a
      "#3.19"="">3.19</a>).
    If you'd rather not fight, zapping a wand of poison at the Assassin
    Prince will poison and eventually kill him without turning him
    hostile. This is probably a bug.

    <h3>2.12 Tomb of the High Kings</h3>
    The Tomb of the High Kings is located in a dungeon found in the
    northwest corner of the Drakalor Chain. The PC must have a climbing
    set to reach it (and to leave that section of the map). Dropping
    your climbing set in the staircase immediately before descending
    past the first level is a good idea, to prevent it from getting
    destroyed by traps/breath attacks and thus leave you trapped here
    until you find another one. The fact that a climbing set is required
    means that the PC must do some work to find one prior to entering
    the dungeon. This ensures that brand new PCs do not enter this
    location. The dungeon consists of two normal levels followed by
    three cavernous levels leading to the tomb. The cavernous levels are
    somewhat challenging, as are most cavernous levels.
    <p> The tomb itself consists of a short winding corridor leading to
      a large chamber. The chamber contains a lake which is unique in
      that the water is red rather than blue. This should serve as a
      warning. It is filled with chaos piranhas that deal 100d4 points
      of damage during each turn the PC is in the lake. This is the
      place where the Bridge Building skill or the ability to freeze
      water (yielded by the Terinyo quests) becomes vital.</p>
    <p> Teleportation is not allowed on this level, so do not count on
      it to get your PC out of a tight spot.</p>
    <p> The PC must build a bridge or create an ice bridge to an island
      located in the lake. Remember that ice bridges will only hold the
      PC's weight plus 2000 stones before breaking. Anything that
      freezes water will work including monsters (section <a
        href="#0.13.8.1">0.13.8.1</a>) On the island is a 1 x 1 room
      protected by a locked and trapped door. Upon opening the door, a
      skeletal king is found guarding the Ring of the High Kings.<br>

    <h4>2.12.1 Skeletal King <tt>Z</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 50, PV: 30, Hits: 248, Attacks: 3, Damage: 3d10+8, Speed 120.</pre>
    The skeletal king is a somewhat nasty foe who is able to confuse the
    PC. This is not a good thing when the PC is perched on a bridge,
    liable to stumble to certain death in the piranha infested waters
    below. Some means of confusion resistance is therefore highly
    recommended. The skeletal king is immune to the chaos piranhas so
    luring him into the lake will not kill him. He is vulnerable to
    undead slaying ammo, of course. He is not difficult to kill in melee
    for a mid-level PC with a decent melee attack. He never summons help
    on his own level, but if lured off the level, he will. He does not
    see invisible.
    <p> Note that it is not necessary to kill the skeletal king to claim
      the Ring of the High Kings. The ring is lying on the floor of the
      room where the skeletal king is first found, so in principle it is
      possible to lure the king away, grab the ring, and make a hasty
      retreat.</p>
    <p> The objective of this dungeon, the Ring of the High Kings, is
      Greater Identified as follows: </p>
    <pre>---------------------- ring of the High Kings [+2, +3] ---------------------

Weight: 1s

When worn it modifies DV by +2 and PV by +3.

When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1
points of damage.

It grants resistance to fire.
It grants resistance to poison.
It grants resistance to cold.
It grants resistance to shock attacks.
</pre>
    The Greater Identify does not reveal the most important property of
    the ring, however: it allows peaceful passage past the Eternal
    Guardian (see section <a href="#3.12">3.12</a>).

    <br>
    <p> The Water Dragon's Lair is located in a random water-containing
      square of the wilderness. It contains Shyssiryxius, the water
      dragon (Blup's mother), her treasure hoard and various other
      aquatic beasts. It consists of a labyrinth and a central room
      containing Shyssiryxius and the treasure. The entire cave is
      submerged, so ordinarily some means of water breathing and the
      Swimming skill are required. The most common method of obtaining
      water breathing is through a helm of water breathing (generally a
      "blue helmet" before identification). Wearing two rings of the
      fish (or one blessed) also grants this, although they are
      autocursing. If the PC is not born with the Swimming skill, it can
      be obtained from Blup by giving him potions of carrot juice. The
      need for these abilities ordinarily keeps low level PCs out of the
      lair, which is as it should be. The aquatic beasts found in the
      labyrinth are not trivial, especially the dragon turtles. Sharks
      and giant eels can also be found. None of these monsters see
      invisible.</p>
    <p> In theory a PC with on demand teleportation, high hit points and
      possibly some regeneration could survive a teleport to
      Shyssiryxius (36 squares to the left), a chat and a teleport to
      the up stairs without water breathing or Swimming.</p>
    <p> There are two main reasons for entering. The first is to <tt>C</tt>hat
      with
      Shyssiryxius then return to Terinyo. This allows the PC to inform
      Blup about the location of his mother, which results in eventual
      delivery of the rune-covered trident, a decent artifact weapon and
      missile, later in the game. The trident will arrive by a water
      elemental messenger not long after reaching character level 16 for
      PCs born in the Raven starsign. Others have to wait until level
      36. </p>
    If Shyssiryxius is killed before Blup has been informed of her
    whereabouts, the PC will not receive the Rune covered trident;
    however, once Blup has been informed, she can be killed even if the
    trident has not yet arrived without forfeiting it - she already sent
    it, after all. The location of the lair is not decided until the PC
    starts searching for it, so it is more or less possible to place it
    in a convenient location, such as near Terinyo.
    <p> The second reason for entering the lair is to loot it. There are
      occasionally outstanding items found in the treasure hoard. As
      might be expected, Shyssiryxius does not take kindly to thieves
      and will attack. She does not see in darkness, however. Cast
      Darkness over desired item(s), pick them up and leave.</p>
    <p> Monsters tamed in the underwater cave can leave with the PC and
      breathe air. This is probably a game bug.<br>

    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 70, PV: 40, Hits: 1140, Attacks: 3, Damage: 6d15+12, Speed: 120.</pre>
    Under normal circumstances, Shyssiryxius is not hostile, only
    intimidating. If she is <tt>C</tt>hatted with, she roars "HAST YE
    SEEN MY BABY?" (or "*DIE*" if the PC has done something to make her
    hostile). Whether she is hostile or not, the PC can leave after
    chatting and report back to Blup. This of course assumes a PC facing
    her when she is hostile survives (see below). If the PC attempts to
    steal from her treasure hoard, she gives a warning about not picking
    anything up. If the PC persists, she will attack. She is a
    formidable opponent with a reasonably powerful melee attack and a
    deadly water breath attack that is capable of dealing circa 100
    points of damage in a single round. Sources of water breathing will
    reduce the damage of this attack. She regenerates and is immune to
    cold. She is capable of teleporting and does so when she panics,
    making the PC work to find her while remaining underwater the whole
    time. She can be killed, but it takes an upper level PC, and it
    doesn't hurt to have some blessed potions of extra healing along.
    Note that Shyssiryxius, like certain other powerful monsters, is
    unable to fight in Darkness unless panicked. She is also vulnerable
    to poison.

    <h3>2.14 Ruined City</h3>
    <p> The Ruined City is the entrance to the Minotaur Maze, found in
      the far western central part of the wilderness map.</p>
    <p> Upon entering the wilderness square containing the ruined city,
      the following messages are generated: </p>
    <pre>As you advance into the ruins, you catch a short sight on some
strange huge figure...

With fluid motions it disappears into the ruins!

Something seems to be waiting for you...

You enter the ancient street of a long-dead and even longer-forgotten
city.

Various trees and shrubs have overgrown the monuments of a former
civilization. Strange unknown runes cover what remains of ancient
palaces and buildings. Some forboding evil seems to lurk beneath
the peace of death emanating from this strange place.
</pre>
    A map of the ruined city reveals the strange huge figure to be a
    minotaur mazelord guarding the entrance to the Minotaur Maze hidden
    behind a secret door.

    The minotaur mazelord guarding the entrance may or may not be
    hostile. This may be alignment dependent (he seems to be always
    hostile to lawfuls), among other things and needs further
    investigation.
    <p> There is a lower experience level limit in order to enter the
      Minotaur Maze, which is level 22. PCs with lower experience level
      are frightened away. Likewise, there is an upper limit, which is
      experience level 30. The entrance to the Minotaur Maze is covered
      by an immovable stone block at this point. Given the extremely
      nasty nature of the Minotaur Maze, the player is well advised to
      have the PC as experienced as possible before entering.</p>
    <p> The fact that it closes at PC experience level 30 is a potential
      game-breaker. If the PC drops a Chaos Orb in the Maze, then
      achieves experience level 30 outside, the game is over. Since the
      Chaos Orb is inside an inaccessible location, it will never be
      possible to open the passage to D:49. Note this same scenario can
      occur with the Pyramid (section <a href="#2.9">2.9</a>).</p>
    <p> The objective is to find the Minotaur Emperor on level seven of
      the maze. He holds the artifact Axe of the Minotaur Emperor.</p>

    The mazes are very challenging, with false staircases, illusionary
    walls, living walls, wall beasts, and a variety of minotaurs,
    including minotaur mazemasters, mazelords, magi and kings. The
    minotaurs have powerful melee attacks and should not be
    underestimated. If panicked, all minotaurs will trigger traps and
    may reveal illusionary walls as they retreat. Minotaur mages are
    particularly troublesome, since they can cast a very potent
    confusion spell and will drain attributes with frightful efficiency
    in melee range. They are highly vulnerable to stun rays. Living
    walls are similarly dangerous because of their high PV and ability
    to drain Strength.
    <p> There is no random food generated in the mazes. The minotaurs
      leave corpses, but they are not good to eat because they cause
      confusion. Minotaurs may drop food when killed. The mazes are
      heavily trapped. It is wise to leave unnecessary equipment behind
      in order to prevent its destruction. Since a climbing set is
      required to reach this portion of the map, climbing sets should be
      left behind. The down staircases may lead to false levels, which
      must be explored only to find that there are only up staircases
      with no down staircase (unless the player keeps reading this GB).
      Eventually the PC will find a true level six with a down
      staircase.</p>
    <p> Minotaurs often panic when 'severely wounded' and run away. This
      can be useful. Minotaurs only set off the traps in the mazes when
      in a state of panic. Once they reach the panicked state, they seem
      to set off every trap they cross. It is thus possible to use them
      strategically to clear a path for the PC.</p>
    <p> The player will likely want some way to mark illusionary walls.
      The easiest way is to drop a gold piece on either side of the
      wall. The position of the wall will then remain marked on the map
      even if a monster later picks these coins up.</p>
    <p> The easiest and most painless way to complete the maze is to
      have numerous blessed scrolls of magic mapping and on-demand
      teleportation. Simply read the scroll, and teleport to the stairs.
      Repeat until the bottom is reached. Due to the large number of
      levels in the maze, many scrolls may be required. With some
      planning six scrolls is more than enough and you might have eight
      from bug temple.</p>
    <p> It is very obvious when the true bottom of the maze has been
      reached, because the following level message is generated: </p>
    <pre>"You feel that this maze level is special in some respect... its convoluted
tunnels remind you of the brain tunnels of some sinister power lurking
beneath the surface of the world and ready to strike at any intruders!"
</pre>
    A representative layout of the final level of the Minotaur Maze is

    <h4>2.14.1.1 How to find out whether the new level is false?</h4>
    All you have to do when you find a down stairs is:
    <ol>
      <li>find a trap in the new level... not too hard ;) </li>
      <li>calculate the level's top trap type, see <a href="#Appendix_L">Appendix
          L</a>, or the below table </li>
      <li>see if it is +5 from the last level </li>
    </ol>
    <p> If it isn't you're on a false level. Turn back.</p>
    <p> The mazes actually contain 19-21 levels, as shown below. True levels are 1, 2b, 3d, 4d, 5e, 6c, and 7.
      Optional levels are 4e and 5a. The stairs between levels 4d-5d and 5e-6b are also optional.</p>

    <h4>2.14.1.2 Minotaur Emperor <tt>M</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 50, PV: 35, Hits: 420, Attacks: 4, Damage: 3d20+30, Speed: 140.</pre>
    The Minotaur Emperor is surrounded by four minotaur mages which are
    able to cast confusion. The mages are vulnerable to Stun Ray which
    stops their confusion attacks and leaves them vulnerable. The
    Minotaur Emperor is most easily killed with Web and missiles. Melee
    is ill-advised. When the Minotaur Emperor is killed, he drops
    several items which may vary. One example is:
    <pre>    blessed axe of the minotaur emperor (+12, 3d20+16) [-6, +4]     [1200s]
    uncursed potion of strength                                        [4s]
    uncursed potion of cure corruption                                 [2s]
    blessed potion of cure corruption                                  [2s]
    uncursed spellbook of Slow Monster                               [100s]
    uncursed minotaur emperor corpse                                 [240s]
    uncursed topaz                                                     [1s]
</pre>
    Like all high-ranking minotaurs the emperor's corpse heavily
    confuses, decreases Willpower by -8 and increases Perception,
    Strength and Toughness by up to 3 each; but also corrupts (about 1
    effect). A blessed greater ID of the Axe of the Minotaur Emperor
    reveals:
    <pre>------------ axe of the minotaur emperor (+12, 3d20+16) [-6, +4] -----------

Weight: 1200s

When worn it modifies DV by -6 and PV by +4.

When used in melee combat it grants a +12 bonus to hit and causes 3d20+16
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a -12 bonus to hit and
causes 3d16+6 points of damage.

It is very good at scoring critical hits in melee.
It grants resistance to confusion attacks.
</pre>
    Note the weight of the artifact axe. The weight of the artifact,
    combined with the extraordinary difficulty of the mazes, makes most
    players completely ignore this location. It is in no way necessary
    to complete the game.
    <p> <small> In v1.2.0, the axe is 4d20+16 and also grants see
        invisible. The emperor also drops a random artifact, several
        potions of gain attributes and two more spellbooks. </small></p>

    <h3>2.15 Rift</h3>
    The Rift is a wilderness location found in the northwestern
    mountains, southeast of the dungeon containing the Tomb of the High
    Kings. The PC must meet several requirements in order to enter it:
    <ul>
      <li>Climbing skill must be at 100. </li>
      <li>The PC must be at least experience level 18. If the experience
        level requirement is not met, the game responds with: "You do
        not feel experienced enough for this daunting task." </li>
      <li>Willpower must be at least 20 OR Perception must be less than
        6. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> If all these requirements are met, the PC will still most likely
      fall on the way down the Rift, destroying some equipment in the
      process. High Luck, the light and nimble corruption, and the very
      light corruptions are supposed to make the descent easier: in
      practice, they may only help in reducing equipment damage.</p>
    <p> There are 27 checks. You have a chance to fall at each check and
      you always fall at least once. Chances not to fall: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>50% Chance (assuming the required 100 Climbing) </li>
      <li>25% Chance </li>
      <li>Willpower / 100 Chance </li>
      <li>Courage / 1000 Chance </li>
    </ul>
    <p> If you fail all these checks, a counter is incremented. That
      counter is directly proportional to the health (1d8+2) and
      inventory damage done.</p>
    <p> You can approximate this counter by the messages generated:</p>

    <p> It is not possible to bring artifacts only into the Rift, since
      a climbing set (and probably food, although enough <i>might</i>
      be found) is required. Therefore, it is a good idea to store the
      PC's extremely valuable items, such as scrolls of chaos
      resistance, in a safe place before entering the Rift. It is also a
      good idea to bring every bit of junk, such as missiles that do not
      stack, low quality armor and weapons, scrolls of ill fate, cure
      blindness and the like, low quality amulets, etc. along. These
      items are fodder for the RNG, which hopefully will destroy them
      rather than valuable equipment. Do not be too conservative and
      leave <i>all</i> good equipment behind, because the monsters in
      the Rift dungeon and especially the Sinister Library of Niltrias
      can be <i>very</i> nasty. Hopefully by this point, the PC has
      some decent artifact armor and weapons. A corollary is not to rush
      into the Rift too soon.</p>
    <p> It is not necessary to visit the Rift dungeon or the Sinister
      Library of Niltrias to complete the game, and many who play
      non-spellcasters completely ignore it.</p>
    <p> The whole point of entering the Rift is to gain access to the
      Sinister Library of Niltrias - see next chapter.</p>
    <p> After the PC climbs (falls) down the Rift, he arrives in the
      Rift dungeon on RL3. The dungeon consists of nine levels, which
      are numbered in the opposite sense compared to every other dungeon
      in the game (the Tower of Eternal Flames is an exception) - RL1 is
      the bottom, while RL9 is the top. There is a guaranteed source of
      water-breathing at the bottom of the rift. An amulet/helm of water
      breathing is generated somewhere in a corridor. The item is always
      generated cursed. This dungeon features dangerous monsters -
      greater chaos servants, chaos mutants, elementals, greater
      elementals and higher level quicklings are not uncommon. Two up
      staircases will be found on RL5 or RL6. One leads to the higher
      Rift dungeon level, the other leads into the wilderness in a pass
      inside the unclimbable mountains. A short journey, which requires
      a climbing set, leads to the entrance to the Sinister Library of
      Niltrias.</p>

    <h4>2.15.1 Ratling Dealer <tt>r</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 30, PV: 0, Hits: 60, Attacks: 3, Damage: 1d6+1, Speed: 150.</pre>
    If the PC was unlucky enough to have his climbing set destroyed
    during the descent through the Rift, another is available from a
    unique Ratling Dealer on the bottom level of the Rift dungeon, RL1.
    This NPC is nonhostile in an otherwise rather hostile environment.
    As a consequence, it is quite possible for him to be killed by other
    monsters. If the PC needs a climbing set from him, find him quickly
    and be prepared to pay 50,000 gold pieces for it.
    <p> The Ratling Dealer always asks for 50,000 gp or the whole amount
      of gold the PC is carrying, whichever is more. Drop any excess
      gold if you want to buy the climbing set from him.</p>

    <p> The Ghost Librarian <tt>G</tt> is nonhostile (see the section
      below).</p>
    <p> There is a certain amount of variation in the items found in the
      Library; this map was generated with a Wizard PC. The items in the
      eastern chamber and the large main room will be scrolls rather
      than spellbooks for non-wizards. This is a good thing, since
      scrolls are useful for all classes, while non-spellcasters are
      often unable to read spellbooks efficiently or at all. Note the <tt>]</tt>
      in the southwest corner. It is a climbing set, which is required
      to get back into the Rift dungeon. Equipment may be destroyed
      while in the Library, so it is prudent to leave the climbing set
      where it is until the PC is finished with the rest of the Library.
      There will be monster guardians found on top of every spellbook or
      scroll. These monsters can be anything and are uniformly
      dangerous. Master lich, ancient dragons, quickling lord, frost
      giant jarl, stone giant lord, moloch and mimic hivemind were found
      among others. It is wise to bring dragon slaying ammo in case an
      ancient karmic dragon is generated. Likewise, demon slaying ammo
      or phase daggers are very nice to have in case a (greater) moloch
      is generated.</p>
    <p> Wizards and Necromancers who visit the Library will find every
      spellbook available in the game, including Wish. Other classes
      will not. They find scrolls in the two large rooms and spellbooks
      in the small northeast room and the hidden passageway. Spellbooks
      can be destroyed while in the Library (by blue dragons, for
      example), so be careful with rare spellbooks.</p>

    <p> <a name="2.16.1"></a></p>
    <h4>2.16.1 Ghost Librarian <tt>G</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 55, PV: 0, Hits: 125, Attacks: 2, Damage: 3d10+1, Speed: 100.</pre>
    The Ghost Librarian will bless the PC for 2000 turns if <tt>g</tt>iven
    a scroll or book.
    <p> The player should be careful to ensure the Ghost Librarian's
      safety. Since the librarian is non-hostile, the monsters that
      guard the stacks might potentially attack her. It's a good idea to
      use a wand of door creation to seal off the library's lobby. Even
      then, monsters that teleport or smash doors might potentially get
      in and kill her.</p>
    <p> The Ghost Librarian is the source of an important artifact, the
      Weird Tome. </p>
    <pre>-------------------------------- weird tome --------------------------------

Weight: 100s

When used in melee combat it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d2 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d2
points of damage.
</pre>
    In order to obtain the Weird Tome the PC must have Stealth at 100
    and spend at least 2000 turns in the Library without <tt>C</tt>hatting
    to monsters. Wizards, for instance, can cast spells throughout their
    combat in the Library and, after vanquishing the monsters, read some
    spellbooks to pass time before <tt>C</tt>hatting to the Ghost
    Librarian. At that point the Ghost Librarian will reward the PC with
    the Weird Tome, which can be exchanged for five cursed scrolls of
    chaos resistance courtesy of the Mad Minstrel. Getting the Weird
    Tome sets Literacy to 100. If the PC <tt>C</tt>hats with the Ghost
    Librarian too soon, she responds with "Respect the Silence!" and the
    2000 turn counter is reset. If 2000 more turns pass in silence, the
    Weird Tome can still be obtained.
    <p> It is impossible to read the Weird Tome. The message generated
      is: </p>
    <pre>This book is filled with strange texts written in weird
letters. You have difficulties concentrating on the text. After a while
you manage to focus your sight on the text. The text contains a strange
collection of tunes, songs and instrumental pieces. It seems to be some
kind of code, hinting at some ancient powerful magic, a scroll or
something like that... You fail to decipher it.
</pre>
    Most characters who attempt to read the Weird Tome are Confused for
    a considerable length of time (20d100 turns). Do not try it in a
    potentially dangerous location! You can only read the Weird Tome if
    you are Bard, have both Literacy and Music at 100, have 50+
    Willpower and 60+ Learning.
    <p> The 2000 figure for the turns spent without <tt>C</tt>hatting
      may not be an absolute. There may be a die roll for a very small
      chance that a PC will be unable to get the Weird Tome no matter
      the length of the wait.</p>
    <p> Research on the Weird Tome is far from complete. See section <a
        href="#5.5">5.5</a> for details.</p>

    <p> The Stone Circle is located in the northwest part of the
      wilderness map. It can only be entered by PCs who have satisfied
      the Demented Ratling (section <a href="#3.5.8">3.5.8</a>).
      Furthermore, it can only be entered during very last hour of
      Darknight, between 23:00 and 00:00 (press <tt>Ctrl-e</tt>). The
      best tactic is to wear seven league boots and walk in wilderness
      squares next to the Stone Circle. Keep a very close eye on the
      clock and note how much time each move takes so you can calculate
      your steps exactly. The message "One of the monoliths seems to
      contain a shimmering portal." is generated when the PC stands on
      the Stone Circle square when it is eligible for entrance.</p>
    <p> The Stone Circle is located on a plain. There is an entrance
      tunnel guarded by two chaos knights who should not be a problem
      for a PC at this level. The doorway into the circle is guarded by
      two annihilators, who can annoyingly destroy the PC's equipment.
      Ideally the PC should be invisible and destroy them from a
      distance. The alternative should be to hit them as hard as
      possible with the best melee attack available.</p>
    There is a unique pool inside the Stone Circle. Drinking from it
    results in the message "You feel altered in an eerie way." It always
    causes ~2 corruptions.

    The circle itself contains Keriax in the center with eight writhing
    masses of primal chaos scattered about the walls of the room. It is
    important to dispatch Keriax quickly, as he has a variety of very
    nasty attacks. He is able to breathe bolts including corrupting
    bolts, confuses the PC and drains attributes if engaged in melee.
    His melee attacks are not corrupting, although he has five attacks
    per round and uses poison. He has one of the strongest confusion
    attacks in the game, regularly confusing high Wi PCs with confusion
    resistance. He is vulnerable to confusion himself, however. He is
    vulnerable to the Acid Ball spell, stunning, paralyzation and dragon
    slaying ammo. Potions of blindness, invisibility and cursed potions
    of invisibility work on him. Killing him from a distance is highly
    recommended. His corpse grants large increases to Strength,
    Toughness, Mana and Perception, but also causes massive corruption -
    about 8 corruptions. If he is killed late in the game and a PC needs
    corruptions for an Avatar of Balance or Ultimate Chaos God ending,
    this is one way to get them quickly.
    <p> The objective here is the Crown of Chaos, which Keriax holds. As
      with all parts of the Chaos Trinity, it corrupts the PC merely by
      carrying it. Put it someplace safe until it is needed. </p>
    <pre>------------ Crown of Chaos (-6, -6) [+0, +15] {Ma+10} (+10 spd) -----------

Weight: 500s

When worn it modifies DV by +0 and PV by +15.

When used in melee combat it grants a -6 bonus to hit and causes 1d3 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a -6 bonus to hit and causes 1d3
points of damage.

It modifies your mana attribute by +10.
It contains the essence of Chaos and Corruption.
It modifies your speed by +10.
It grants bad luck.
It grants resistance to petrification.
Wearing it makes you doomed.
It grants resistance to death attacks.

    <p> The Quickling Tree can be found in any portion of the forested
      wilderness west of the river. This means that a PC should <tt>s</tt>earch
for
      it in a convenient place, such as next to the Mad Minstrel's
      clearing. It can be found at any time, but to actually enter it
      usually requires two corruptions: the extremely thin and nimble
      and the very light corruptions. This is because the PC must weigh
      no more than ten kilos to enter the tree. Hurthlings are often an
      exception: they can enter the Quickling Tree with only the thin
      and nimble corruption (which is required under any circumstances).
      Also, the weight of the PCs inventory is limited to 160 stones.
      This means eternium plate mails, crowns of leadership and the like
      are not going to be useful. In fact it is worth picking up any
      light armor the PC finds throughout the game and identifying all
      of it at some point in case any of it is useful in the Quickling
      Tree.</p>
    <p> Quicklings use hand crossbows and dark elven quarrels (tiny
      quarrels) as missile weapons and drop them as they are killed.
      Some prior experience with crossbows is therefore useful.
      Quicklings fall fairly easily in melee, with missile weapons or
      using magic. They are just very, very fast. Only the king and
      queen see in darkness and see invisible.</p>
    <p> The whole point of entering the Quickling Tree is to eat the
      corpses of the quicklings as they are killed, which provides speed
      bonuses. There are plenty of corpses generated for a PC with a
      good Food Preservation skill, so an amulet of hunger or
      stomacemptia herbs are useful in the tree. As would be expected,
      the higher level quickling corpses give better speed bonuses, so
      the quickling lord corpses should be eaten first. The tree
      contains a quickling king and quickling queen, whose corpses
      provide the best speed bonuses if they are generated, but they
      also shorten the PC's life span. This is where those potions of
      longevity come in handy for races with relatively short life
      spans.</p>
    <p> Monsters generated in the Quickling Tree are: 75% quickling, 20%
      quickling lord, 3% quickling king, 2% quickling queen. </p>

    If it is desired, the PC may tunnel directly south from the entrance
    room into the room containing the high level quicklings. Time passes
    very quickly in the Quickling Tree. It is not unusual to enter on
    day 70 and find that it is day 140 upon emerging. This means the 90
    day limit has passed and background corruption will become faster.

    <h3>2.19 Unicorn Glades</h3>
    Guth'Alak, the druid in Terinyo, will reveal the location of the
    Greater White Unicorn's glade once the PC reaches experience level
    30, regardless of the PC's alignment. He asks the PC to search a
    beautiful park in the central forest for a good and noble creature
    in need of help. Upon returning to the central forest, the glade
    appears as a green asterisk near the Old Barbarian's clearing. It is
    described as "A beautiful park." prior to entering.

    <p> After entering the glade, Yrruir can be found teleporting around
      randomly. Despite the fact that Guth'Alak reveals this location
      regardless of alignment, Yrruir generally attacks PCs with chaotic
      alignment on sight. There have been rare and scattered reports of
      chaotic PCs who were not attacked. Yrruir will not attack a lawful
      PC even if she is attacked by them. When <tt>C</tt>hatted with,
      Yrruir explains that the forces of Chaos have stolen a part of her
      life essence and forged it into her evil counterpart, manifested
      as a Greater Black Unicorn. Yrruir asks the PC to kill her
      counterpart in order to regain the stolen life essence and restore
      her full powers. If the PC is successful, Yrruir rewards the PC
      with an offer to cleanse all corruption <i>once</i> and only
      once. A player who completes this quest has to carefully decide
      when to take advantage of Yrruir's offer. If the PC is badly
      corrupted prior to entering the lowest parts of the CoC, it will
      probably be necessary to have all corruption removed before the
      endgame. However, it is best to have Yrruir remove all corruption
      as the last thing the PC does before leaving the Drakalor Chain,
      if the player is concerned with receiving the highest possible
      score and happiest future history after finishing.</p>

    <p> Riurry can be found in a corrupted glade just east of Yrruir's
      glade. As an evil chaotic being, he of course offers rewards if
      the PC kills Yrruir when <tt>C</tt>hatted with. If the PC then
      returns to Yrruir, she is warned not to listen to Riurry's evil
      babbling. Killing Yrruir at this point will result in a
      significant alignment drop, of course, but causes no other
      noticeable effects. The PC does not lose the Lucky or Fate smiles
      intrinsics, nor does she gain the Cursed or Doomed intrinsics.
      Returning to Riurry and <tt>C</tt>hatting results in being
      rewarded with 1-2 corruptions, a blessed amulet of chaos and 3d3
      uncursed potions of gain attributes. The player has to decide
      which path to take. The potions of gain attributes are a
      significant reward. If the player is going for an Ultimate Chaos
      God ending, it seems logical to accept Riurry's quest. Other PCs
      may choose this quest if corruption is either not a problem or
      desired for chaos gate entry. The alignment drop may also be
      useful for becoming chaotic around experience level 30 in order to
      receive Gaab'Baay's quests, for those PCs attempting an ultra
      ending.</p>

    <h3>2.20 Scintillating Cave</h3>
    The Scintillating Cave is a cave that appears in the northwest
    section of the map (next to the Minotaur Maze) once the player has
    completed the quest to kill Filk, the quickling bard.
    <p> The Scintillating Cave features eight cavernous levels, with all
      the inherent dangerous associated with these, including open
      tension rooms, and high monster generation featuring very
      dangerous monsters: ancient karmic dragons, greater molochs and
      emperor lichs are common. It is best to simply get to the down
      staircases as quickly as possible unless the PC is an absolute
      walking tank by this time. All of the levels of the Scintillating
      Cave feature a dangerously high corruption rate, so it is
      generally not advised to spend inordinate amounts of time fighting
      monsters here. The last level is particularly corrupting, is not
      cavernous, and is home to the powerful Emperor Moloch. Killing the
      Emperor Moloch will give the player the crumpled scroll, which is
      necessary to obtain the Trident of the Red Rooster. Note that the
      crumpled scroll is not an artifact, and thus is vulnerable to
      damage from fire, water, etc. It is recommended that the player
      read the crumpled scroll at the earliest opportunity, since this
      will allow the crumpled scroll to be rewritten using a magical
      writing set.</p>
    <p> Altars may occasionally spawn in the Scintillating Cave;
      however, these may also be destroyed by rampaging molochs.</p>
    <p> <a name="2.20.1"></a></p>
    <h4>2.20.1 Emperor Moloch</h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 3, PV: 200, Hits: 1395, Attacks: 1, Damage: 36d12+12, Speed: 85.</pre>
    Emperor Moloch is the guardian of the crumpled scroll. He is by far
    the physically strongest and toughest monster in the game, with a PV
    of 200 and the capability to deal hundreds of damage in a single
    attack. Engaging him in melee is thus extremely risky. Since like
    all molochs he punches through armor, the PC's only defense against
    his attacks is DV; having extremely high HP is also a must for the
    PC. Phase daggers, or even better a weapon with the 'of penetration'
    suffix, might be necessary to damage him; these weapons should be
    blessed to further increase damage output. Otherwise the PC will
    need a powerful weapon of demon or humanoid slaying, high
    effectivity ball spells or greater telekinetic blast. In addition,
    the level he resides on is massively corrupting. He must be killed
    quickly or lured off the level.
    <p> Whilst it <i>is</i> possible to kill the moloch in straight up
      melee combat, ranged tactics may be a good idea for PCs lacking
      stellar endurance and/or Strength scores; particularly since the
      moloch is easy to outrun and has no ranged attacks. He is immune
      to fire and cold, though; and presumably has a high chance to
      shrug off other magical bolts. PCs relying instead on archery
      should use their stocks of blessed penetrating ammo against him.</p>
    <p> Note that a wish for "emperor moloch", whilst he is still alive,
      will instead spawn about 20 hostile greater molochs. It is also
      worth noting that as well as the crumpled scroll, the moloch is
      also guaranteed to drop his moloch armor when slain. </p>
    <pre>----------------- moloch armor (-8, -16) [-32, +50] {Dx-20} (-20 spd) -----------------

When worn it modifies DV by -32 and PV by +50.
When used in melee combat it grants a -8 bonus to hit a causes 3d10 points of damage.
When used as a missile it grants a -16 bonus to hit and causes 3d10+2 points of damage.

It modifies your dexterity attribute by -20.
It modifies your speed by -20.
It grants immunity to fire.

    <h3>3.1 Early levels of the Caverns of Chaos (CoC)</h3>
    The early levels of the CoC should not be a problem for PCs that
    manage to make it this far. They are comparable in difficulty to the
    Village Dungeon or the Unremarkable Dungeon. It is never wise to
    become overconfident, however. Even these levels may contain lesser
    vaults, tension rooms and named artifact guardians. There may be a
    split in the early dungeon levels of the CoC. Two down staircases
    may be available. This is by no means guaranteed.
    <p> When two down staircases are found on D: n (n=1 or 2), the level
      D: n+1 has a roughly 50% chance of containing a lesser vault. The
      level S: n+1 will never contain a vault. This suggests the S level
      may stand for 'S'afe or 'S'hortcut.</p>
    <p> The main objective in the early part of the CoC is to find the
      Arena. More about the Arena level is found in the next section <a
        "#3.2"="">3.2</a>.</p>

    <p> The Arena level is found on D: 3-5. It can be immediately
      recognized by repeated messages saying "You hear the ecstatic
      cries of a large crowd!" As might be expected at a huge attraction
      like the Arena, there are vendors selling items on this level.</p>
    <p> The Arena itself is for combat practice, with the rewards for a
      successful fight being gold pieces. The rewards get larger as the
      PC wins more fights. A PC should not fight more than nineteen
      times in the Arena before descending to deeper levels of the CoC.
      This is because she will encounter an NPC later (see <a
        "#3.5.3.1"="">3.5.3.1</a>) who assigns a quest to win the 20th
      Arena fight.</p>
    <p> <a name="3.2.1"></a></p>
    <h4>3.2.1 20th Arena opponent</h4>
    The 20th fight will be against a named former champion. These
    opponents are more difficult than the standard Arena opponents.
    There are four possibilities:
    <p> </p>
    <table>
      <caption>Possible 20th arena opponent</caption> <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Opponent </th>
          <th>Race </th>
          <th>Remarks </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Li-Hon-Kay </td>
          <td>ogre magus </td>
          <td>uses Invisibility and Frost Bolt, regenerates; alternate
            name Li-Han-Kay </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Spardakius </td>
          <td>minotaur </td>
          <td>brute force </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Ripclaw </td>
          <td>troll </td>
          <td>brute force </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Bonk </td>
          <td>hill giant </td>
          <td>brute force </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p> Li-Hon-Kay can be particularly annoying and dangerous. PCs
      without cold resistance and the ability to see invisible will
      probably not survive a fight with Li-Hon-Kay. Fortunately, cold
      immunity and the ability to see invisible are granted by the
      Ancient Mummy Wrapping, an artifact armor held by Rehetep, the
      Mummy Lord (see section <a href="#2.9.2.1">2.9.2.1</a>).
      Players who want to be conservative and maximize the chances of
      survival in the 20th Arena fight will tackle the Pyramid first.
      Note also that although ogre magi are somewhat resistant to
      confusion, if one is successfully confused using Mindcraft, they
      are unable to become invisible. This works for Li-Hon-Kay as well
      as ordinary ogre magi. The other 20th fight Arena opponents will
      fall to offensive magic or simple brute force bashing.</p>
    <p> The reward for winning the 20th Arena fight is an artifact
      sword, the Golden Gladius. </p>
    <pre>------- golden gladius "Death's Sting" (+2, 2d5+2) [+3, +3] (+7 spd) -------

Weight: 30s

When worn it modifies DV by +3 and PV by +3.

When used in melee combat it grants a +2 bonus to hit and causes 2d5+2
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a -4 bonus to hit and
causes 1d3 points of damage.

It modifies your speed by +7.
</pre>
    There are a limited number of fights available after the 20th fight,
    but beware: anything can be generated as an opponent in such fights.
    It is quite possible to be faced with an emperor lich or ancient
    karmic dragon. The monetary rewards for such fights are about 1000
    gold pieces each, not worth it if the PC has to face a difficult
    opponent. Furthermore, the experience gains from these fights are
    dependent on the experience level of the PC. Those who have
    difficulty gaining experience (Trolls, Raven-born Athletic Monks,
    etc.) should leave these fights for when they are at a high
    experience level.

    <h4>3.2.2 Remaining arena opponents</h4>
    Timofei Shatrov has determined the possible opponents the PC will
    face in the Arena. There are five possible opponents in each fight,
    although some of them are duplicates. The table below shows the
    possible opponents, with cats in bold capitals and duplicates in
    parentheses:

    <h4>3.2.3 Dak, the arena master <tt>@</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 22, PV: 12, Hits: 108, Attacks: 2, Damage: 1d8+12, Speed: 100.</pre>
    The Arena Master provides access to the Arena. Note that he will not
    admit invisible PCs to the Arena, whether or not they have fought in
    the Arena before. He responds with "Sorry, we've hired more than
    enough invisible stalkers. Look for a job elsewhere or come back
    when some of yer pals are used up." Player with permanent
    invisibility obtained from a pool or invisible stalker corpse can
    only enter the Arena under the influence of a potion of visibility.
    For this reason it may be wise to at least finish 19 arena fights,
    if not become a champion altogether, before the PC drinks from any
    pools. If the PC teleports out of the Arena without killing the
    opponent and returns to Dak, he tries to stun, then confuse, then
    paralyze the PC before teleporting him/her back into the Arena.
    <p> Note that it is possible to unintentionally cause Dak to become
      hostile during an arena fight, eg. if he is hit by a ball spell
      that reaches outside the front entrance of the Arena. Doing so
      will end the fight after a certain amount of turns, and cause the
      Arena Master to attack without giving a reward for the completed
      fight (and, of course, forfeit the possibility of any future
      fights and rewards).</p>
    <p> Also, if you create a closed door on the tile the PC is
      teleported to after winning a fight, it will be opened and the
      message "You hear a short clapping sound" is displayed upon
      winning again. This is the only way to teleport on top of a door
      in ADOM, and according the old bug tracker, said effect was
      intentionally coded for this sole possibility.</p>
    <p> <a name="3.2.4"></a></p>
    <h4>3.2.4 Ratling traders <tt>r</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 16, PV: 0, Hits: 10, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d6+1, Speed: 100.</pre>
    There are several ratling traders on the Arena level who sell food.
    The best food source is cooked lizards, which weigh only 3 stones
    each and are very nutritious. Also available are fried bats, which
    are less nutritious, but still acceptable. It is not worth buying
    rat tails, fat worms, and cooked roaches. They have very low
    nutrition value, even for Trolls, who can eat almost anything. See <a
      href="#Appendix_G">Appendix G</a> for details.
    <p> In contrast to shops, which restock dependent on total game time
      passed, the ratling traders seem to restock dependent on game
      passed on the Arena level only. Thus a PC may go off adventuring
      for many days, return to the Arena and find no new food available.
      Wait or run around on the level for a while and the traders should
      eventually restock.</p>
    <p> It is worthwhile to <tt>n</tt>ame the ratling traders according
      to the wares they sell. This prevents aimless searching for the
      traders who sell worthwhile food. They can also be slowed down
      with the Slow Monster spell, which will not turn them hostile.</p>
    <p> <a name="3.2.5"></a></p>
    <h4>3.2.5 Ratling rebel <tt>r</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 19, PV: 4, Hits: 18, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d6+1, Speed: 100.</pre>
    The ratling rebel plays no important role. He provides scrolls
    denouncing arena fights. They can be sold for small amount of cash,
    used for training Literacy, cleared with a potion of water for use
    with a magical writing set, or polymorphed with blessed potion of
    exchange or potion of raw chaos to turn them into a more useful
    scroll. Note there is no danger of explosion. The ratling rebel will
    attack PCs wearing furs when chatted with. Another way to make him
    hostile is to <tt>g</tt>ive him back his pamphlet. He rewards PCs
    that kill Dak the Arena Master with a scroll of peace, and alignment
    shift towards N=. After obtaining the scroll of peace from him, he
    will not give pamphlets anymore.
    <p> <a name="3.2.6"></a></p>
    <h4>3.2.6 Cats in the Arena <tt>f</tt></h4>
    Cats in the Arena are a special problem. If the PC wants the Ring of
    the Master Cat, directly killing cats must be avoided (see section <a
      "#0.9.2"="">0.9.2</a>). There are several ways to deal with cats
    in the Arena. Teleportation is one, from a wand or spell. Potions of
    exchange thrown at a cat will turn it into another monster. A cat
    can be led over a trap until it is killed, teleported or turned into
    a writhing mass of primal chaos. However, if the PC sets off a trap
    which kills a cat, he is charged with killing the cat. For this
    reason, as well as general tactical information, it is useful to
    know the layout of traps in the Arena when they are created. A map
    showing the traps produced when the Arena is generated on D: 3 is
    shown below:
    <pre>  ###############.###############
  #0123456789AB0###456789AB01234#
  #123456789AB0123456789AB012345#
  #23456789AB0123456789AB0123456#
  #3456789AB0123456789AB01234567#
  ###############################

    0 - fireball      6 - arrow
    1 - pit           7 - acid
    2 - light         8 - pit (vipers)
    3 - corruption    9 - spear
    4 - stone block   A - teleport
    5 - alarm         B - water
</pre>
    The pattern shifts, but otherwise remains the same, and can
    therefore be worked out by creating a single trap, when the Arena is
    generated on other levels.

    <h3>3.3 Big Room</h3>
    The Big Room is found on level six or seven of the CoC. It is indeed
    one big room with no walls. This means it is not possible to use
    corridors to restrict monster movement. If there are many monsters
    present they can always swarm the PC. Breeders and summoners are
    thus very dangerous on this level. If the PC does not have poison
    resistance this level is exceptionally dangerous since dark elven
    wizards and dark elven priestesses who summon poisonous spiders are
    guaranteed to appear sooner or later. Breeders can get completely
    out of control on this level. Even if they can't really hurt the PC,
    once a high enough number breed and <i>continue</i> to breed the PC
    can't kill them as fast as they are being generated. Being trapped
    like this will lead to starvation eventually. Remember that breeders
    can be sterilized by a scroll of vermin control or divine
    intervention.
    <p> Herbs are guaranteed in the Big Room which leads to the dilemma
      of whether to stay and harvest herbs or flee from the constant
      onslaught of monsters.</p>

With a bit of planning and minimal amount of equipment, it's possible
to fight monster generation, to the point that no new monsters appear
on the level for the rest of the game, letting you harvest your herbs
in peace.

In order to achieve the desired effect, using this particular
solution, in this particular level, one needs...

* a breeder.

* 14 doors, forming an enclosed area of 8*5 or 7*6 squares, or 1-13
doors and a method of digging, enclosing an area of at least 40
squares total.

The first thing to do is to find a breeder and leave it somewhere,
until you have the necessary equipment. For those who like to do
things the alternative way, and are in a position to do so before
finding a naturally generated breeder from a nearby CoC level (or the
Big Room itself), find/create a corruption trap and lure a regular rat
over it... to generate a chaos rat... which is a breeder.

I'll provide two examples on how to proceed from here, depending on
the amount of doors you're planning to invest in this.

Example 1 (14 doors, no digging):

Choose a corner that would disturb your herb patterns the least, and
create the doors, like this:

#..........
#+++++++...
#......+...
#......+...
#......+...
#......+...
#......+...
#......+...
#......+...
###########

Now, get the breeder from wherever you left it, and lure it inside the
box. Close the doors, so that the breeder won't escape and wait
outside. Protect the doors from random passers-by and observe the
occasional popping/burping sounds.

Once the amount of breeders reaches 40, all monster generation in the
level stops. Start to wander further from the box and kill the
remaining monsters from the level.

Example 2 (1 door, some digging):

At first, it would seem that the big room has no walls to dig, but
upon further investigation this appears to not be the case. You can
dig one square left, one square up, three squares right and two
squares down, into the wall. This leaves the lower right corner as the
obvious choice to start digging, and the two-square wide corridor in
the right side allows for getting around the initial breeder without
needing a second exit. Enclose a 40-square area...

   ####
####..#
...#..#
...#..#
...#..#
...#..#
...#..#
...#..#
...#..#
...#..#
...#..#
...#..#
...#..#
...#..#
...#..#
...#..#
..+#..#
###...#
#.....#
#######

...get the breeder inside and apply the same method as in the first
example.

If everything went well, you're now looking at a completely peaceful,
guaranteed herb level, which is guaranteed to be in a non-corrupting
zone.

    <h3>3.4 Si <tt>]</tt></h3>
    <pre>------------------------------------ si ------------------------------------

Weight: 10s

When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d4 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a -4 bonus to hit and causes 1d4
points of damage.
</pre>
    The si (abbreviation for strange item, pronounced "see") is the
    first guaranteed artifact that most PCs will encounter, unless they
    have done the Keethrax quest. It is found on level 8 of the CoC. The
    level message "The air of this level is filled with a strange
    smell." is always generated when entering the level containing the
    si. It falls into the tool category and is thus represented by a <tt>]</tt>
    character. It always lies on a trap, so <tt>k</tt>ick it off of the
    trap before picking it up if possible.
    <p> The si is an artifact that replicates. Since they are artifacts,
      they are: </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>indestructible - wield them as a melee weapon to prevent
        corrosion/damage from jellies if nothing better is available </li>
      <li>valuable - sell them to shopkeepers: potentially limitless
        cash </li>
      <li>sacrificial fodder - sacrifice them to the gods, although it
        may be more beneficial to sell them and sacrifice the gold </li>
    </ol>
    <p> All of these properties together make sis rather nice items.
      Always keep at least one.</p>
    <p> Note that sis do not count as an artifact as far as the Demented
      Ratling is concerned. Also never forget that they replicate. They
      can get heavy after a while. A particularly nasty effect results
      if sis are brought into the ID. On a long trip through the ID, sis
      will replicate to the point where they become annoyingly heavy.
      This would not be a problem if the PC could simply drop most of
      them. Unfortunately, they jump back into the PC's backpack before
      he leaves a level, no matter where on the level they were dropped.
      Furthermore, monsters will not pick up sis, so they cannot be
      gotten rid of that way.</p>
    <p> Think very carefully before bringing sis into the ID on an
      anticipated long trip. Many castings of Strength of Atlas is
      virtually the only guaranteed safe method of dealing with them.
      Girdles of carrying and girdles of greed, for example, can be
      cursed by a hag or destroyed outright.</p>
    <p> <a name="3.4.1"></a></p>
    <h4>3.4.1 Si growth</h4>
    The rate of growth of sis seems to be based on their
    blessed/uncursed/cursed status. A simple test of a PC with a single
    si in his inventory waiting for periods of 1000 turns reveals that,
    on average, a single cursed si will grow into 1.7 sis every 1000
    turns, a blessed si will grow into 2.2 sis every 1000 turns, and an
    uncursed si will grow into 1.3 sis every 1000 turns. Of the newly
    generated sis, the test suggests that 82.5% will be uncursed, 4.7%
    will be blessed, and 12.7% will be cursed. Note that since each
    newly generated si in turn replicate into further sis, the overall
    rate of si growth will be exponential in nature.

    <p> Dwarftown is an important milestone in the game. It is a source
      of numerous helpful NPCs and locations, including a shop, a
      smithy, a coaligned altar (for non-chaotics) and a training hall
      where attributes may be increased. Of equal importance is the fact
      that it is a resting place. After the descent through the upper
      CoC, the PC can rest here without constantly being assaulted by
      monsters. There is nothing hostile in Dwarftown initially, with
      the exception of an almost-guaranteed mimic in Waldenbrook's shop
      (note the empty space in the shop in the map below - it is a
      mimic).</p>

    <p> <a name="3.5.1"></a></p>
    <h4>3.5.1 Waldenbrook, the shopkeeper <tt>@</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 12, DV: 22, PV: 10, Hits: 343, Attacks: 3, Damage: 3d6+18, Speed: 150.</pre>
    Waldenbrook has a general store type of shop selling and buying a
    variety of goods. He occasionally stocks an item or two of high
    quality, sometimes even an artifact. His prices are generally
    reasonable. Bear in mind, however, that he has the same racial
    prejudices as all other shopkeepers (see section <a
      href="#0.13.7.3">0.13.7.3</a>). He will become hostile if any
    resident in the city is attacked, and when turned hostile he summons
    many muscular dwarves (as opposed to other shopkeepers that summon
    thugs).
    <p> <a name="3.5.2"></a></p>
    <h4>3.5.2 Ruun, the priest <tt>@</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 15, PV: 5, Hits: 120, Attacks: 2, Damage: 2d4+12, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Ruun is always generated with the same race as the PC. He presides
    over a small room containing an altar, which will be coaligned
    unless the PC is chaotic. If a coaligned PC is carrying unidentified
    potions, it is worth <tt>C</tt>hatting with him. He will identify
    potions that have a healing effect: potions of (extra/ultra) healing
    and potions of cure poison. If a PC whose alignment does not match
    the altar's <tt>C</tt>hats with him he responds with "Ye oughta
    convert. Then we'll talk."
    <p> Donating gold to Ruun moves the PC's alignment closer to that of
      the altar.</p>
    <p> Note that converting the altar in Dwarftown (perhaps even
      attempting to convert it) will cause Ruun to become hostile, which
      in turn causes the entire town to become hostile. Ruun can attack
      with energy bolts, and heal himself with spells. Luring him out of
      Dwarftown, killing him and then returning will not work either, as
      his shade returns to inform the dwarves of what has happened,
      resulting in the same scenario. Unless your PC knows exactly what
      she is doing and why she is doing it, angering or attacking Ruun
      is highly inadvisable. See also section <a href="#3.5.8">3.5.8</a>
      below about the Demented Ratling and causing commotion in
      Dwarftown.</p>
    <p> The stubborn singlemindedness of the Dwarves regarding Ruun has
      an interesting side effect. If a pet, slave or the greater daemon,
      for instance, kills Ruun the entire town including Thrundarr (but
      not Waldenbrook) will pursue that creature. This is another way to
      get Thrundarr off his lever.</p>

    <h4>3.5.3 Thrundarr, the ancient dwarf <tt>h</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 10, PV: 100, Hits: 4, Attacks: 1, Damage: 6d4+6, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Thrundarr is the village elder. He can provide background
    information on a variety of subjects (Dwarftown, City, Chaos,
    Corruption, Khelavaster, Terinyo, Waldenbrook, Glod, Garth, Grizzled
    Gladiator, Torgall, Orc, Si, Flame, Fire, Axe, Gold, Phial,
    Caladriel, Eternal Guardian, King, Banshee, Griff, Rolf, Groron,
    Gorko), none of which is really crucial to completing the game. He
    assigns six lawful quests regardless of alignment. They are listed
    in the next section.

    Two Dwarven Elite Guardians stand guard outside Thrundarrs' house.
    They are extremely strong, and are not to be taken lightly. They
    also defy entrance towards dwarven elder for blind or mute
    characters.
    <p> <a name="3.5.3.1"></a></p>
    <h4>3.5.3.1 Thrundarr's quests</h4>
    Several quests are available from Thrundarr once the PC achieves
    experience level six. Talking to Thrundarr about <tt>quest</tt>
    provides access to them:
    <p> The first five quests are available in this order: </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Slay a random creature. This can be a very annoying quest.
        Thrundarr can assign anything ranging from a goblin to a Ghost
        Lord. The random creature is randomly created for danger level
        Max(PCLevel, DwarftownDL) + 3. Only creatures with relative
        probability 25 or higher will be chosen. The random creature is
        a not too rare creature that could be found by the player during
        normal playing. No dwarves, lawful creatures or vortices will be
        assigned. Also, quest monsters are generated with extra HP based
        on PC's level. The reward is having the PC's entire inventory
        identified or the (artifact) potion of literacy for illiterate
        characters.
        <pre>---------------------------- potion of literacy ----------------------------

Weight: 2s

When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d2 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d2
points of damage.

(the potion of literacy grants Literacy when consumed)
</pre>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>Find out what is beyond the Animated Forest. The PC has two
        choices here: traverse the Animated Forest or bypass it and
        descend through the Dwarven Halls. See section <a href="#3.6"
         >3.6</a> about these locations. The reward for this
        quest is a blessed wand of fireballs with twelve charges. This
        comes in very handy in the Pyramid (see section <a href="#2.9"
         >2.9</a>).
        <p> WARNING:<br>
          Be very careful when wandering around below Dwarftown before
          receiving this quest. Entering the Animated Forest for even a
          single turn before the quest is assigned results in Thrundarr
          refusing to assign it, instead assigning another random
          monster quest with <i>no reward</i>. Since the wand of
          fireballs (blessed with twelve charges, no less) can be very
          useful, entering the Animated Forest before the quest is
          assigned is very unwise. Note that this does not occur if the
          PC enters the Dwarven Halls.</p>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>Kill the ogre tribe below Dwarftown - the staircase to this
        level is generated between the Dwarven Mystic's room and the
        Green Griffon Inn. See section <a href="#3.5.3.2">3.5.3.2</a>
        below about this quest. The reward is 5000 gold pieces, useful
        for training with Garth (see section <a href="#3.5.5">3.5.5</a>).
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>Become the Champion of the Arena - if the PC is already the
        Champion of the Arena, another random monster quest is assigned
        - a very good reason <i>not</i> to become the Champion until
        this quest is assigned. Instead of a cash reward, the PC is
        given an artifact sword, the Golden Gladius, for winning the
        20th Arena fight. Thrundarr's rewards for this quest are usually
        pieces of equipment which vary according to the class of the PC
        and possibly the RNG. A couple of examples:
        <p> A Mindcrafter (probably) received: </p>
        <pre>       blessed mithril cap [+0, +2]                         [40s]
       blessed adamantium chain mail (-1, -3) [-1, +8]     [288s]
       blessed mithril girdle [+0, +2]                      [20s]
       blessed adamantium long sword (+0, 1d8+5)            [28s]
       blessed medium mithril shield [+5, +1]               [80s]
       blessed ring of fire resistance                       [1s]
       blessed adamantium boots [+0, +3]                    [89s]
</pre>
        A Wizard and a Beastfighter both received:
        <pre>       heap of 8 blessed bandages                           [16s]
       blessed waterproof blanket                           [10s]
       blessed fireproof blanket                            [10s]
       blessed ring of fire resistance                       [1s]
       heap of 5 uncursed potions of extra healing          [10s]
       uncursed potion of gain attributes                    [4s]
       uncursed potion of ultra healing                      [2s]
       blessed scroll of familiar summoning                  [2s]
</pre>
        The bandages, blankets, etc. seem to be the most common set of
        equipment received as a reward for this quest.
        <p> These are nice enough, but of no great consequence in the
          context of the whole game. Of greater importance is the fact
          that the PC now has the Golden Gladius. It can be exchanged
          for training with Bart the grizzled gladiator. See section <a
            "#3.5.7.1"="">3.5.7.1</a> below.</p>
        <p> It is also possible to receive the artifact dwarven shield
          "Rolf's Saviour" as a reward for this quest. Lawful alignment
          is requirement along with cooperation from the RNG (1/6
          chance, 4/9 for Dwarves). </p>
        <pre>--------------- dwarven shield "Rolf's Saviour" (+2) [+9, +6] --------------

Weight: 120s

When worn it modifies DV by +9 and PV by +6.

When used in melee combat it grants a +2 bonus to hit and causes 1d6 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d6
points of damage.

It grants resistance to fire.
It grants resistance to poison.
It grants resistance to cold.

(if you dual-wield the Dwarven Shield &amp; the Dwarven Rune Axe, you get a +10 bonus
to hit and damage)
</pre>
        <p> </p>
      </li>
      <li>Slay a greater daemon <tt>&amp;</tt> that has been
        terrorizing Dwarftown.
        <pre>Level: 1, DV: 24, PV: 9, Hits: 132, Attacks: 3, Damage: 2d10+9, Speed: 100.</pre>
        The greater daemon's HP is increased by (PCLevel + DwarftownDL)
        * 2. If the player is above level 15, the daemon's level is then
        increased by (PCLevel - 15). The daemon can be a difficult
        opponent, particularly if it becomes entangled with the dwarves
        in the city. Bear in mind the fact that the greater daemon can
        kill NPCs who may be helpful later. This includes the Demented
        Ratling, which destroys the possibility of any special ending.
        The greater daemon breathes fire and is an attribute drainer. It
        can be sacrificed on the altar in Dwarftown. If the PC is lucky
        enough to have found demon slaying ammo, use it! There will be
        more found later. The reward for this quest is the artifact mace
        Big Punch, which many PCs find useless because it is so heavy -
        800 stones. It is potential sacrificial fodder.
        <pre>------------- lead-filled mace "Big Punch" (+1, 8d5+3) [-6, +0] ------------

Weight: 800s

When worn it modifies DV by -6 and PV by +0.

When used in melee combat it grants a +1 bonus to hit and causes 8d5+3
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and
causes 1d4 points of damage.

It grants resistance to stunning.
</pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p> Thrundarr's sixth quest, available at any time and often taken
      out of order by many players, is to free the spirit of Griff
      Bloodax, a dwarven hero who has been turned into an undead dwarven
      chaos berserker by the master necromancer Nonnak. It is necessary
      to ask him about <tt>portal</tt> to obtain this quest. In return
      for completing this quest, Thrundarr provides some equipment
      rewards (see section <a href="#2.7">2.7</a>) and more
      importantly opens the dwarven portal leading to the deeper CoC.
      Note that it is not strictly necessary to do this quest. Thrundarr
      stands on a lever that controls the portal. If he is removed from
      that location, the PC can <tt>h</tt>andle the lever himself.
      Methods for accomplishing this include teleporting Thrundarr,
      Ventriloquism, confusing him and killing him. Some of these
      actions may make Thrundarr hostile and cause future quests from
      him to be lost.</p>
    <p> Thrundarr is teleportation resistant, thus using charges from a
      wand of teleportation is not recommended unless there is no
      alternative. A PC with the Teleportation spell has no problem.
      Teleporting him causes no alignment drop; Thrundarr does not
      become hostile and he will still assign quests, and even asks the
      PC to go to his house and pull the lever if you complete the
      portal quest and <tt>C</tt>hat with him.</p>
    <p> Kherab's second quest is to kill Thrundarr. Killing him is a
      rather drastic act with all sorts of negative consequences. He is
      not a terribly powerful opponent, but has immense PV. Penetrating
      weapons or spells are necessary to kill him. Using Ventriloquism
      on him is fairly easy, confuses him and causes him to wander off
      the lever. It causes an alignment drop roughly equivalent to
      killing him but does not curse or doom the PC nor are muscular
      dwarves summoned. It does make Thrundarr hostile after he recovers
      from his confusion. This causes an amusing scenario as the
      non-hostile dwarves encounter a hostile Thrundarr wandering around
      Dwarftown chasing the PC.</p>
    <p> Drakeling spit will also cause him to move from the lever
      without negative consequences. This is presumably a bug.</p>
    <p> The PC should actually do the quest unless there is a very
      specific reason not to do so, since there are very useful
      artifacts generated during the quest. See section <a href="#2.7"
       >2.7</a> for more about this quest.</p>
    <p> <a name="3.5.3.2"></a></p>
    <h4>3.5.3.2 Ogre Cave <tt>O</tt></h4>
    <pre>Ogre: Level: 1, DV: 9, PV: 5, Hits: 23, Attacks: 1, Damage: 2d6+2, Speed: 100.
Magus: Level: 1, DV: 13, PV: 7, Hits: 44, Attacks: 2, Damage: 2d8+5, Speed: 100.
Lord: Level: 1, DV: 14, PV: 15, Hits: 95, Attacks: 2, Damage: 2d10+14, Speed: 100.</pre>
    There is an ogre tribe containing 37 ogres, 2 ogre maguses, 1 ogre
    lord below Dwarftown which Thrundarr asks the PC to eliminate. Their
    level is proportional to PC's level. Still, this quest is relatively
    easy compared to getting through the Animated Forest or Dwarven
    Halls. The ordinary ogres have no special attacks and the PC should
    be able to bash them with brute force combined with missile attacks
    or blast them with magic. Weaker races might find a corpse or two
    that grants a Strength increase. A potential problem is the ogre
    magi present on the level. They are capable of becoming invisible
    and casting Frost Bolt. PCs who have no cold resistance need to
    watch out for them. Wear an amulet of the cold heart if the PC has
    one. There are also a couple of ogre lords present, which are
    tougher than the ordinary ogres. Once again, none of the ogres can
    see in darkness. Pets cannot inflict any damage on the level. Do not
    rely on them.

    <h4>3.5.4 Dwarven Mystic <tt>h</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 10, PV: 0, Hits: 4, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d2, Speed: 100.</pre>
    The Dwarven Mystic is found in a 2 x 2 sealed room east of the room
    containing the altar. The most common way to get in is by
    teleporting. There is a 25% chance of failing to enter the room as
    he will always occupy one of the spaces. The Dwarven Mystic is a
    guaranteed source of the artifact dwarven rune axe Rolf's Companion
    for lawfuls.
    <pre>------ dwarven rune axe "Rolf's Companion" (+3, 3d6+6) [+4, +4] {To+3} -----

Weight: 50s

When worn it modifies DV by +4 and PV by +4.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 3d6+6
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +4 bonus to hit and
causes 3d8+4 points of damage.

It modifies your toughness attribute by +3.
This weapon returns when thrown.
It grants resistance to fire.

(if you dual-wield the Dwarven Shield &amp; the Dwarven Rune Axe, you get a +10 bonus
to hit and damage)
</pre>
    Neutrals never receive the axe, but rather 7 blessed potions of
    insight and 4 blessed potions of chaos resistance, OR 2 potions of
    training and 1 potion of gain attributes (50% chance for each case).
    <small>In v1.2.0, the latter comes also with a ring of ice.</small>
    Chaotics will receive nothing from him. He responds with the message
    "It wasn't you I've been waiting for!"
    <p> Note that teleportation traps may be conveniently generated
      adjacent to and within the dwarven mystic's room. However, this is
      only possible if Dwarftown is generated on D: 11.: </p>
    <pre>  .....^
  .####.
  .#.^#.
  .#^.#.
  .####.
  ^.....
</pre>
    The carets represent locations where a teleportation trap may be
    created.
    <p> It is also possible to open the walls of the Dwarven Mystic's
      room with a wand of destruction. This is somewhat dangerous, since
      nearby townspeople, and perhaps the Dwarven Mystic himself, may be
      damaged by the blast, causing some, or all, inhabitants of
      Dwarftown to become hostile. If the player is careful, it is
      possible to destroy the walls, <tt>C</tt>hat with the Dwarven
      Mystic and receive his rewards in the usual manner.</p>
    <p> If a PC with non-chaotic alignment has committed a crime in
      Dwarftown which results in an alarm gong being rung and muscular
      dwarves being summoned, the Dwarven Mystic responds with a
      different message "Ye art doomed!" This does not result in the PC
      gaining the cursed or doomed intrinsics. A wished-for Dwarven
      Mystic also always responds with this message.</p>

    <h4>3.5.5 Garth, the dwarven weaponmaster <tt>h</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 25, PV: 12, Hits: 129, Attacks: 4, Damage: 2d8+12, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Garth is found in the training hall east of Thrundarr's room. Garth
    will train all attributes except Appearance and Mana. The formula
    for how much to pay is $100 * attribute value, doubled once for each
    5 points over 15. Here are examples of what to pay Garth:

    <p> Note that the effects of training do not happen instantaneously.
      The attribute has simply been trained. The game checks every so
      often (and always when gaining an experience level) to see if an
      attribute is eligible for an increase. This is when the attribute
      will rise. Note also that it is possible to pay Garth once and
      receive several attribute increases as a result. This is
      particularly useful for those PCs with a very low attribute score
      in one or more categories. Paying Garth well in excess of the
      amount needed to raise the attribute will result in multiple
      attribute increases over time.</p>
    <p> Note that there is a manual entry under the Attributes section
      that states the following:</p>
    <p> "The potential maximum attribute scores are based on the initial
      attribute scores. The maximum for an attribute is dependent on the
      base score and the player race. These maximums can only rarely be
      surpassed by natural training. This is a long and arduous process.
      Only magical methods can exceed these limits with ease."</p>
    <p> This seems to imply that Garth cannot train an attribute beyond
      its natural maximum. This may be true under "reasonable"
      circumstances. Giving Garth massive amounts of gold may be a
      different story.</p>
    <p> The method described above is somewhat obsolete. Here are lists
      of how much you should pay to guarantee an increase in an
      attribute - you can pay less money for less than a 100% chance.</p>

    <h4>3.5.6 Glod, the dwarven smith <tt>h</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 14, PV: 12, Hits: 115, Attacks: 3, Damage: 2d10+6, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Glod will teach the Smithing skill. There is a price for this which
    depends on gender, Charisma, cursed status, doomed status, and race
    (see <a href="#0.15.4">0.15.4</a>). Smithing is taught at 1d10 +
    20. It also trains Strength +100 and Toughness +200.
    <p> Glod is also capable of removing rust from rusted items and
      fixing certain broken items, notably pickaxes, again, for a price
      of ItemValue * 150 if pickaxe, or ItemValue * 1500 otherwise.
      Removing rust costs ItemValue * 30. It means corroding pickaxes by
      attacking ochre jellies and gray oozes with them will decrease
      Glod's repair fee. It has been reported that after removing rust
      from an item a number of times, Glod will offer to rustproof the
      item.</p>
    <p> After learning the Smithing skill, Glod will make his equipment
      available to the PC for 2500 gold pieces.</p>
    <p> It is possible to teleport Glod away from his smithy, although
      the details (wand of teleportation vs the Teleportation spell)
      have yet to be worked out. He wanders in Dwarftown but still asks
      for the nominal 2500 gold piece fee (seemingly telepathically,
      probably a bug) after this. However, at this point, he can be
      lured off the level if he is adjacent to a staircase, like any
      other inhabitant of Dwarftown. After Glod is left on another
      level, his demands for payment cease. Note that this may involve
      considerable tedium as the PC attempts to lure Glod off the level.</p>
    <p> It is possible to kill Glod (using acid spit or bolt spells
      while invisible, for instance) without making the rest of
      Dwarftown hostile (although Waldenbrook may become hostile), thus
      making his smithy available for free, but beware of his multiple
      penetrating attacks. One method of killing him involves using the
      greater daemon generated by Thrundarr's fifth quest. If the
      greater daemon is lured near Glod, it will kill Glod.</p>

    <h4>3.5.7 Green Griffon Inn</h4>
    The Green Griffon Inn holds two useful NPCs described below. It is
    located in the southeast corner of Dwarftown.
    <p> <a name="3.5.7.1"></a></p>
    <h4>3.5.7.1 Bart, the grizzled gladiator <tt>@</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 13, PV: 7, Hits: 130, Attacks: 3, Damage: 2d6+8, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Bart provides teaching in three skills: Backstabbing, Tactics and
    Two Weapon Combat in exchange for the Golden Gladius, the artifact
    sword provided as a reward for winning the 20th Arena fight. Tactics
    is available only from him. The proficiency at which the PC learns
    these skills seems to depend on Learning. With very high Le,
    receiving Tactics directly at 100% has been reported. He also
    provides some training in weapon skills, raising all zero level
    skills to level one and providing small bonuses to other weapon
    skils. The number of weapon marks that he gives seems to be
    (Learning)d10. The training in weapon skills is secondary as
    compared to granting the Tactics skill, which is of much greater
    importance in the game.

    <h4>3.5.7.2 Torgall, the dwarven inn keeper <tt>h</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 36, PV: 20, Hits: 74, Attacks: 3, Damage: 1d4+13, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Torgall is the innkeeper in the Green Griffon Inn. In return for a
    gold piece, he will sell the player a drink along with a helpful
    hint (as can be found in fortune cookies, see <a href="#0.15.8">0.15.8</a>).
    Note that too much ale causes the PC to become Drunk.
    <p> <a name="3.5.8"></a></p>
    <h4>3.5.8 Demented Ratling <tt>r</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 10, PV: 0, Hits: 120, Attacks: 2, Damage: 3d3+3, Speed: 120.</pre>
    The Demented Ratling is an important NPC for all PCs trying for a
    special ending. He demands to be fed six artifacts in exchange for
    revealing the secret of the Stone Circle, where the Crown of Chaos
    can be found. He will only talk to chaotic PCs. He becomes much more
    powerful each time he is fed an artifact. This is important to
    remember. If the PC is going to cause commotion in Dwarftown, for
    example in order to fulfill Kherab's second quest, it should only be
    done after feeding a number of artifacts to the Demented Ratling.
    Otherwise the Demented Ratling may be killed in the ensuing battle
    for control of Dwarftown.
    <p> The Demented Ratling gains 10 levels for each artifact he is
      fed. This increases his stats dramatically:</p>

    <p> A wished-for Demented Ratling will make the usual demand for six
      artifacts from a chaotic PC, but will not eat an artifact.
      Instead, he responds with "Ya naw will neeta die!" He is not

      PC is fallen champion.</p>
    <p> It is possible to anger the Demented Ratling to the point where

      all six artifacts have been delivered, <i>do not</i> continue

    <h3>3.6 Animated Forest and Dwarven Halls</h3>
    Thrundarr asks the PC to pass through the Animated Forest and find
    out what lies beyond. He also mentions a possibly dangerous shortcut
    which turn out to be the Dwarven Halls DH: 1 and DH: 2. On
    approximately D: 13 there will be a level that has two down
    staircases. One leads to the Animated Forest, the other to the
    Dwarven Halls. It is impossible to tell them apart.
    <p> <a name="3.6.1"></a></p>
    <h4>3.6.1 Animated Forest <tt>P</tt></h4>
    <pre>Tree: Level: 1, DV: 10, PV: 15, Hits: 68, Attacks: 2, Damage: 2d8+5, Speed: 100.</pre>
    Passing through the Animated Forest is a test of one's patience
    among other things. The entire level is filled with living trees
    milling about. The majority are not hostile but will of course
    become hostile if attacked. It is difficult to get through them
    without accidentally hitting one or more. When the PC encounters
    hostile trees it is best not to try to fight them but rather keep
    moving. In fact it is usually best to be as defensive as possible
    and forget about offense completely: wield two shields and use
    Coward tactics. The hostile trees will usually be left behind in the
    crowd. It seems to be best to keep moving in any case and refrain
    from resting on one square. Invisibility is a tremendous asset in
    the Animated Forest, but PCs usually do not have it available at
    this stage of the game. Note that fireballs, from the wand or spell,
    as well as the Burning Hands spell, should not be used in the
    Animated Forest. While they are effective, the whole forest becomes
    hostile. This generates too many hostile trees for a PC at this
    level to cope with. Interestingly, fire bolts, from the spell or
    wand, are also effective, but do not cause the forest to become
    hostile. The trees do not see in Darkness, so that tactic can also
    be used.
    <p> Summarizing the methods for crossing the forest: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dual-wielding shields. This prevents the player from
        accidentally attacking non-hostile trees, and provides extra
        DV/PV to reduce damage from the occasional hostile tree. <small>In
          v1.2.0 casting spells is not allowed when dual wielding
          shields.</small> </li>
      <li>Invisibility. The trees cannot see invisible, so this
        (preferably combined with dual-wielding shields) generally makes
        progress much quicker, since even hostile trees will
        occasionally move and allow the PC to progress through the
        forest. </li>
      <li>Darkness. The trees cannot see in darkness, so it is possible
        to blanket the entire level in darkness and fight through the
        trees with minimal risk. In theory, panicked trees will be able
        to hit you if cornered; but it's hard to corner anything in a
        wide open space. It does take a lot of time to go through the
        entire level this way. <small>In v1.2.0, monsters that lack the
          ability to see in darkness will still try to attack.</small> </li>
      <li>Digging. There's just enough space behind the eastern and
        northern walls that can be dug out to create a clear passageway
        around the forest. Close it off using wands of door creation and
        avoid killing any trees henceforth, to minimize the risk of
        trees showing up inside the hallway. </li>
      <li>Teleportation. Controlled teleportation will greatly shorten
        the time spent to cross the forest. While the PC can try to
        teleport directly to the down stairs, if this space is occupied
        (which is likely) this will teleport him to a random spot on the
        level. This is not a bad thing if the PC has just entered the
        Forest and is as far away from the opposite stairs as it gets,
        so it doesn't hurt to try. Otherwise it might be more prudent to
        teleport from empty spot to empty spot until the down staircases
        are in sight, and then teleport on them once they are vacated. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <a name="3.6.2"></a></p>
    <h4>3.6.2 Dwarven Halls</h4>
    The alternative to the tedium of the Animated Forest is a descent
    through the Dwarven Halls. This is much faster but potentially
    dangerous. Very out-of-depth monsters can be generated in the
    Dwarven Halls. Use scroll or wand of monster detection, if possible,
    upon entering each level of the Dwarven Halls. This will allow you
    to immediately identify any dangerous creatures, and make a judgment
    about whether or not the level is remotely safe to explore.
    Furthermore, this will allow you to identify and avoid tension
    rooms. If the PC has invisibility, seven league boots or anything
    that increases speed, wear them before entering in case it becomes
    necessary to flee. Exploring other than finding the down stairways
    is highly inadvisable. Monsters that are probably too dangerous to
    tolerate include: balors, greater daemons, black unicorns, white
    unicorns, lich kings, emperor lichs, chaos wizards, quickling
    queens, diamond golems, ancient dragons, titans. Vortices spawned in
    DH can also do immense amounts damage and must be dealt with
    carefully.
    <p> Summarizing the useful items for the Dwarven Halls: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>blessed scrolls of magic mapping to locate the stairs </li>
      <li>controlled teleportation </li>

    <h4>3.6.3 Your choice</h4>
    Both of these locations can be problematic. The Animated Forest is
    always incredibly tedious. The Dwarven Halls can be a cakewalk if
    the PC is lucky enough to have the stairways generated close
    together. However, if the stairs are distant and the monsters
    dangerous, it is probably advisable to abandon the Dwarven Halls
    entirely and simply cross the Animated Forest. The Halls can also be
    a virtual instadeath if a very nasty monster shows up. As Thrundarr
    says, "It's yer choice."

    <h3>3.7 Khelavaster, the dying sage <tt>@</tt></h3>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 10, PV: 2, Hits: 4, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d4+2, Speed: 40.</pre>
    Khelavaster is the sage who revealed the prophecy about the coming
    of chaos. He entered the dungeons in the Drakalor Chain never to be
    seen again. The PC eventually encounters him below Dwarftown, after
    the Dwarven Halls or Animated Forest, generally on D: 16. By this
    time Khelavaster is mortally wounded and surrounded by chaos
    servants.
    <p> <a name="3.7.1"></a></p>
    <h4>3.7.1 Saving Khelavaster</h4>
    At this time the PC must make a choice about saving Khelavaster. He
    is on the down staircase and it is impossible to descend further
    without saving him or allowing him to die. He will shrug off and
    ignore any non-ball spells, teleport attempts from the wand, and
    Mindcraft, excepting (Greater) Telekinetic Blast which kills him.
    You can't <tt>:s</tt>wap places with him, even with the Monk and
    Beastfighter powers. Companions and monsters will refuse to attack
    him.
    <p> It is however, possible to ascend, leaving the level in its
      state as found for an indefinite period of time. He can only be
      saved by <tt>g</tt>iving him an amulet of life saving <i>before</i>
      <tt>C</tt>hatting with him. There is no guaranteed way to obtain
      an amulet of life saving and they are very rare items. If the
      player is determined to attempt an ultra ending, Khelavaster must
      be saved since he is the only one capable of summoning the Trident
      of the Red Rooster.</p>
    <p> Common methods of attempting to get an amulet of life saving
      include staying in the Infinite Dungeon until one is generated or
      draining every pool the PC has found in the hopes of obtaining a
      wish. A ring of djinni summoning may also be generated in the
      Infinite Dungeon, which provides a wish when blessed. Digging
      graves or dipping amulets/rings into a blessed potion of exchange
      are other options.</p>
    <p> There is a well known (or is the word notorious?) bug in the
      game that occasionally causes an unrecoverable crash when the PC <tt>C</tt>hats
      with Khelavaster. Needless to say, this can be disappointing,
      especially if the player's PC has an amulet of life saving. Make a
      backup before <tt>C</tt>hatting with Khelavaster. This is not
      savescumming. It is avoiding a known fatal bug in the game.</p>
    <p> If Khelavaster is saved, he reappears in invisible form in
      Terinyo late in the game. If the PC gives him the crumpled scroll,
      obtained by killing the Emperor Moloch, he will summon the TotRR
      for non-chaotics. There is a 30 experience level requirement in
      order for Khelavaster to appear in Terinyo, but the PC does not
      need to have the crumpled scroll. <small>In v1.2.0, he is visible
        in Terinyo.</small></p>
    <p> In Terinyo, he is suddenly known as an ancient sage, and his
      stats change: </p>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 200, PV: 3, Hits: 28, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d4+6, Speed: 120.</pre>
    <p> <a name="3.7.2"></a></p>
    <h4>3.7.2 Khelavaster's gifts</h4>
    In any case, Khelavaster reveals a bit about the plot of the game
    including the existence of the chaos orbs and their general
    locations. He also leaves some equipment for the PC. The equipment
    he leaves depends on whether he is saved or dies. The equipment is
    guaranteed, but if he is allowed to die the exact status varies.
    Three examples are shown below.
    <pre>cursed robe [+0, +1]
uncursed boots of sneakiness [+0, +2] {Dx +2}
blessed amulet of protection +2
uncursed eternium dagger (+0, 2d4+7)
cursed wand of digging (4 charges)
cursed potion of invisibility
474 gold pieces

uncursed robe [+0, +1]
uncursed boots of sneakiness [+0, +0] {Dx+5}
uncursed amulet of protection +2
uncursed eternium dagger (+1, 2d4+7)
uncursed wand of digging (4 charges)
uncursed potion of invisibility
271 gold pieces

uncursed robe [+0, +1]
uncursed boots of sneakiness [+0, +0] {Dx+2}
uncursed amulet of protection +2
cursed eternium dagger (+0, 2d4+7)
uncursed wand of digging (4 charges)
cursed potion of invisibility
406 gold pieces
</pre>
    If Khelavaster is saved, the equipment he leaves is (almost) exactly
    the same every time:
    <pre>blessed eternium dagger (+0, 2d4+7)
blessed wand of digging (8 charges)
heap of 4 blessed potions of ultra healing
heap of 6 blessed scrolls of chaos resistance
blessed spellbook of Identify
blessed spellbook of Teleportation
</pre>
    Note the quality of this equipment. The six blessed scrolls of chaos
    resistance alone are roughly equal to two wishes. Thus it is
    definitely worth spending a wish to obtain an amulet of life saving
    for Khelavaster.
    <p> The exact stats of the eternium dagger vary, it may be as good
      as (+0, 2d4+10) and have a prefix or suffix.</p>

    The hallway tunnel contains ghuls, skeletons, zombies, shadows,
    wights and wraiths. Ghosts may pass through the walls into this

    dangerous undead: corpse fiends, ghosts, lichs, mummies and greater
    mummies, skeletal warriors, spectres and vampires. The monsters here
    who see invisible are: mummies, greater mummies and lichs, who are
    also capable of self-healing, casting glowing balls, and confusion.
    <p> The graves are diggable. See section <a href="#0.13.15">0.13.15</a>

    <p> The Water Temple, found on either D: 19 or D: 20, is the first
      elemental temple that most PCs will encounter.</p>

    The right side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself
    is disconnected. Entry must be made by digging. Teleportation is not
    allowed on the level. Note the traps. Note the underscore in the
    center of the temple. This is the chaotic elemental altar where the
    orb guardian is found (at least until it is disturbed and moves).
    The elemental altars are very dangerous. The temples are populated
    by sentient beings who will sacrifice the PC instantly should he
    step on it. In addition, they can only be converted by champions of
    Balance or Order, which means PCs going for an ultra ending cannot
    convert them early in the game, before retrieving the Medal of
    Chaos.
    To attack the temple, the PC must dig in, then attack the monsters.
    It is not necessary to cross the water although it is more
    convenient if this is possible. If the water cannot be crossed the
    Snake can be zapped with a bolt from a wand or spell and will
    eventually emerge. However, it may flee back across the water. Lure
    it to the previous level before attacking. All the monsters are
    vulnerable to fire based attacks. The grues and demons in particular
    are troublesome because they have a corrupting melee attack that has
    a very high to-hit. Even PCs with very good DV will be hit by them
    eventually - a good reason to develop the PC's missile weapon
    skills. The snakes, including the Snake from Beyond, are poisonous.
    Invisibility is tremendously useful. The only monster found here who
    sees invisible is the Snake from Beyond. None of the monsters sees
    in Darkness.

    The Snake from Beyond is a formidable opponent. It generally does
    not kill a PC that has made it this far, but has nasty poisonous and
    corrupting attacks that rarely miss. If possible, it should be
    killed from a distance, easier said than done in the close quarters
    of the Water Temple. It is vulnerable to demon slayers.
    <p> The Snake from Beyond holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Water,
      greater identified as follows: </p>
    <pre>-------------------- Chaos Orb of Elemental Water {Wi+10} ---------------------

It is an artifact.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 2d9+3 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3
points of damage.

It modifies your willpower attribute by +10.

    <h3>3.10 Banshee <tt>G</tt></h3>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 40, PV: 2, Hits: 200, Attacks: 2, Damage: 2d8+6, Speed: 100.</pre>
    The Banshee is found on a level ranging from D: 22-24. The level can
    be immediately recognized by a message referring to sorrow and
    death, and a great amount of corpses located all over the dungeon
    floor. The Banshee is an undead spirit in ghost form. She pines for
    her lost husband. Her wail is instantly fatal to most who come into
    her proximity. She is always found in a room in the center of the
    level.
    <p> PCs can protect themselves in several ways. Deafness is one.
      Deafness can be achieved by <tt>U</tt>sing beeswax. This plugs
      the PC's ears, making her deaf until it is removed with the clean
      <tt>E</tt>ars command. Another way is by drinking a potion of
      deafness. Potions of deafness wear off, but the effects of an
      uncursed potion of deafness will last long enough to kill the
      Banshee. Beware of blessed potions of deafness. They cure deafness
      rather than causing it. Using either method, the Banshee can then
      be attacked safely.</p>
    <p> An amulet of protection from undead mitigates the damage a PC
      takes from the Banshee. It changes from an instant death to 20d15
      damage per round.</p>
    <p> It has been observed from experiments in the Animated Forest
      (see below for more on this) that the death zone surrounding the
      Banshee is four dungeon squares (three diagonally). If a PC keeps
      his distance, it is possible to kill the Banshee from afar. In
      fact, it is not necessary to kill the Banshee at all. If the PC
      zaps a wand of digging to create a diagonal corridor to her room,
      then lures her out while keeping his distance, it will eventually
      be possible to teleport to the down staircase in the center of the
      level. Just don't forget she's still on the level on the way back.
      ;-)</p>
    <p> Alternatively, a male character can wield (in a weapon slot, not
      a ring slot) a wedding ring. In this case the PC in question still
      hears the Banshee's wail, but it does not damage him. The Banshee
      is still hostile, however. The Banshee's wail is displayed to a
      male PC wielding a wedding ring as follows by the game: </p>
    <pre>The banshee regards you in astonishment. "My beloooovvveed huuuusbaaaaaaaaaaannnd!"
</pre>
    Beware of trying to lead the Banshee around while wielding a wedding
    ring. While her wail can be exploited (see below), this is a
    dangerous practice. The wedding ring only works while the Banshee
    can see the PC, so leaving her line of sight for even a single turn
    can be fatal.
    <p> The Banshee routinely shrugs off bolt spells, but can eventually
      be killed using them. She is not difficult to kill in melee.</p>
    <p> Players have exploited the properties of the Banshee by having
      her follow a deaf PC around. Her wail kills many monsters. For
      example, the trees in the Animated Forest are vulnerable to the
      Banshee's wail. <small>(Not in v1.2.0.)</small> As might be
      imagined, dozens of trees dying every few turns leads to some very
      nice treasure. The downside is that the Banshee will become very
      experienced very quickly, thus making her much more difficult to
      dispatch should the need arise. Luring her to Dwarftown causes
      immediate alarm; the whole city will be hostile. Monsters immune
      to her wail are undead, constructs, most uniques, and shopkeepers.
      Banshees can be wished for.</p>

    <h3>3.11 Wall of flames</h3>
    A wall of flames is encountered around D: 27. Even if the PC has
    fire immunity, it cannot be passed without the Chaos Orb of
    Elemental Fire. The Orb is found in the Tower of Eternal Flames. The
    wall of flames forces the player to retrieve it before proceeding.
    See section <a href="#2.5">2.5</a> for more on the Tower of
    Eternal Flames.
    <p> Note that the dungeon levels have an unusual arrangement at this
      point. PCs will suddenly descend from D:24 to D:28 then ascend to
      D:27, D:26, D:25, then abruptly descend to D:29. The wall of
      flames will be found in the middle of this sequence.</p>

    <h3>3.12 Eternal Guardian <tt>@</tt></h3>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 30, PV: 60, Hits: 2400, Attacks: 3, Damage: 5d8+5, Speed: 100.</pre>
    The Eternal Guardian is found one or two levels before the Casino.
    He guards the down staircase on the level. He only allows peaceful
    passage of PCs if they are wearing the Ring of the High Kings,
    obtainable from the Tomb of the High Kings (section <a href="#2.12"
     >2.12</a>). It is definitely possible to pass him without
    the ring, although it presents special problems. The obvious tactic
    of teleporting him away from the stairs does not work, as he is
    resistant to teleportation. Trying to kill him in melee or with
    missiles is more or less pointless, since he reincarnates even if
    the PC manages to kill him, which is very difficult. His hitpoints
    are extremely high even for a boss and his attacks are penetrating.
    Furthermore, his reincarnations will be leveled. If a PC wants to
    pass him without the RotHK, it is best to make him angry such that
    he chases the PC, followed by a quick teleport to the down stairs
    and descent.
    <p> Fighting multiple copies of the Eternal Guardian is a recipe for
      suicide. Or a recipe for lots of experience, if the PC is fast
      enough. The Eternal Guardian is not especially fast, so hit and
      run tactics can be used. He is vulnerable to humanoid slayers or
      ball spells. It takes a lot of either to bring him down though.</p>
    <p> Even if the PC manages to pass him without the Ring of the High
      Kings, the shortcut to the surface through Darkforge (see section
      <a href="#3.14">3.14</a>) will not work in the down
      direction - a distinct disadvantage.</p>
    <p> It is possible to anger the Eternal Guardian, kill his hostile
      copies and still pass peacefully by showing the Ring of the High
      Kings to the nonhostile copy that remains on the stairs. This can
      be used to exploit the Eternal Guardian for experience.</p>

    The guaranteed monsters found here are casino guards (the <tt>@</tt>s
    outside the Great Gift Shoppe), a Big Casino Guard (guarding the
    down staircase) and the shopkeeper (the <tt>@</tt> inside the Great
    Gift Shoppe). The <tt>$</tt>s in the body of the Casino are not
    piles of gold, but rather slot machines. There will be a number of
    non-hostile monsters wandering about the Casino and the Great Gift
    Shoppe.
    <p> It is possible to win essentially unlimited amounts of gold from
      the slot machines. Intrinsic Dooming, Cursing, Lucky and Fate
      Smiles have no effect. Wearing items that grant Luck (the hidden
      property) or the Lucky/Fate Smiles intrinsics make no difference.
      The fastest way to accumulate money is to choose a machine that
      costs 24 gold pieces to play (marked with an <tt>x</tt> on the
      above map) and <tt>h</tt>andle the lever. Place a heavy object on
      the spacebar of your keyboard. Check back after five minutes or so
      by picking up the gold on the floor. There should be quite a pile.</p>
    <p> As long as the technique above is used - simply leaving the
      spacebar depressed - all of this gambling will take place during a
      single game turn, so the PC will not be spending hours of game
      time in the Casino getting corrupted. This is after all D: 30 or
      D: 31, moderately deep in the CoC. So resist the temptation to
      check on your winnings every 30 seconds! ;-)</p>
    <p> A possible side effect of long gambling sessions is stunning.
      Ideally wear a source of stun resistance or have the intrinsic.
      Alternatively, prayer will remove stunning. Despite the fact that
      only a single game turn passes, it is also possible to become Very
      Hungry. Fortunately, the PC cannot starve to death while playing,
      so it is not necessary to eat before using the slot machines.</p>
    <p> This implies, of course, that it is possible to buy everything
      in the Great Gift Shoppe. But how to carry it? Since there is an
      unlimited amount of gold available, a (blessed!) girdle of greed
      can solve that problem. The Big Casino Guard will often allow a
      net winner passage if he simply goes to a slot machine and loses
      one round. Try more than once if necessary.</p>
    <p> The payout from the slot machines follows a precise formula,
      shown below:</p>

    <p> As an example, two goblins results in a return of 4x the
      original bet, for a profit of 3x the original bet. The average
      payout works out to approximately 24x the original bet. This has
      been verified empirically, and agrees with theory.</p>
    <p> Be aware that if the PC uses the slot machines, the Big Casino
      Guard will block the down staircase and expect the PC to spend his
      winnings - and more - in the Great Gift Shoppe, which is
      ridiculously overpriced. This problem can be solved by teleporting
      the Big Casino Guard. This transports him to another location on
      the level. He does not become hostile, does not move and behaves
      exactly as if he were still blocking the stairs (this is probably
      a bug).</p>

    The Casino shopkeeper is worth killing if the PC can manage it,
    however, since he counts for several hundred thousand experience
    points. He is a dangerous foe, however, who frequently panics when
    injured.

    If the player wins any money at slot machines, he will block the
    down stairs and not allow passage unless that much money and more is
    spent at the Great Gift Shoppe.
    <p> Note that he can easily be removed from the stairs by
      teleporting him; this will not make him hostile and he will still
      act as if he is standing on the stairs. In battle, not only is he
      capable of dealing huge amounts of damage, but he may paralyze the
      PC with each damaging hit, making him potentially lethal in melee
      combat. Therefore, the PC should generally be careful not to anger
      him unless they are prepared with ranged attacks and/or
      paralyzation resistance. While he is unique and there is only ever
      one Big Casino Guard generated, more can be wished for.</p>
    <p> <a name="3.13.4"></a></p>
    <h4>3.13.4 Strategies for robbing the Casino</h4>
    It is possible to use Ventriloquism as usual to confuse the Casino
    shopkeeper. Remember if the skill is not at 100 he may become
    hostile in the next turn, so doing this under cover of Darkness is a
    wise precaution. A tactic that accomplishes the same result (no
    cursing, no alerting the guards) is to zap a wand of far slaying at
    him from very far away, 15 squares or more. These are both risky
    since a hostile Casino shopkeeper is a formidable opponent. The best
    sequence of events is to gather everything the PC wants, anger the
    shopkeeper and teleport straight to the down staircase.
    <p> There are a number of events that will cause all the monsters to
      become hostile whether or not the PC has actually picked up
      anything from the Great Gift Shoppe. Directly attacking the guards
      or shopkeeper or zapping a wand of destruction that damages any of
      the guards or the walls of the Great Gift Shoppe are examples.
      Once the monsters become hostile, a number of things happen.
      First, the number of guards on the level approximately triples.
      They cluster around both the up and down staircases and are
      plentiful elsewhere. Second, the teleportation restrictions inside
      the Great Gift Shoppe cease. This means the PC is free to teleport
      to any location on the level, but since the up and down staircases
      will be blocked by guards, it is not possible to teleport to these
      locations and leave the level.</p>
    <p> Invisibility is strange on the level. The casino guards and the
      Big Casino Guard see invisible. The shopkeeper welcomes an
      invisible PC when he enters the Great Gift Shoppe, but when an
      invisible PC picks up an item, the shopkeeper does not immediately
      block the door. The standard "shopkeeper stares at your position
      with great intensity" message must be generated before he blocks
      the door. However, the shopkeeper instantly sounds an alarm when
      an undetected invisible PC who has picked up an item leaves the
      Great Gift Shoppe. Despite this, the shopkeeper does not see the
      invisible PC as he flees through the body of the Casino.</p>
    <p> None of the monsters on the level are able to see in darkness.
      However, some will still cluster around the PC in darkness, while
      others, including the Big Casino Guard who ordinarily blocks the
      down staircase, will wander aimlessly. This means that if a PC
      needs to rest and recover hitpoints, or pray for healing, or drink
      healing potions, darkness is your friend. A PC can stand in one
      spot indefinitely in the dark. The tendency of the monsters to
      cluster around the PC or wander about also means they will leave
      the vicinity of the staircases. Thus a PC can rob the Casino, cast
      Darkness, wait, then teleport to the down staircase. This is
      risky, however, since if the PC is doomed by robbing the Casino
      (see below) there is a 1 in 1000 chance of an instadeath each turn
      from a grue attack (see section <a href="#0.13.4">0.13.4</a>).</p>
    <p> The stats for the shopkeeper above should make it clear that
      speed is critical when robbing the Casino. Anything that increases
      speed is valuable - rings of speed, speed boosting potions and
      especially seven league boots. It is possible to make the
      shopkeeper hostile by throwing missiles or zapping a spell at him,
      ideally from as far away as possible, then literally outrun him
      out of the Great Gift Shoppe. This is one way the Casino can be
      robbed without any spells whatsoever.</p>
    <p> The stats should also make it clear that killing him is worth
      many experience points. This is a consideration for those PCs who
      desperately need experience.</p>
    <p> <a name="3.13.5"></a></p>
    <h4>3.13.5 Consequences of robbing the Casino</h4>
    The consequences of robbing the Casino vary according to a couple of
    factors. First is the alignment of the PC. Lawful PCs will likely be
    cursed and doomed. Neutral PCs will likely be cursed, perhaps
    doomed. Chaotics will probably get away with no cursing or dooming.
    Lawful and neutral PCs will move their alignment towards chaotic.
    This may or may not be visible on the main screen. It is known for
    PCs to be so lawful by this point in the game that their alignment
    does not vary from L+ despite robbing the Casino. The second factor
    is exactly what transpires during the robbery. Killing the
    shopkeeper in the process of robbing the Casino is not recommended
    for crowned champions of Law or Balance, of course. Attacking the
    guards on the way out or after dragging them down to the next level
    should not cause an alignment drop as they will be hostile at that
    point.
    <p> The cursing and/or dooming is obviously the biggest problem PCs
      face after robbing the Casino. Fortunately, there is a shortcut to
      the surface of the Drakalor Chain (see section <a href="#3.4"
       >3.4</a>) available one or two levels below the Casino.
      This makes it possible to get to a coaligned altar near the
      surface quickly and sacrifice in order to get rid of the unwanted
      cursing or dooming, although it is possible at this point in the
      game that the player might want to exploit those intrinsics. In
      any case, remember where those coaligned altars are near the
      surface! If you plan to rob the Casino, they can be essential.</p>
    <p> <small> As of v1.2.0, excessive gambling corrupts, making it a
        less viable option. </small></p>

    <h3>3.14 Shortcut to the surface</h3>
    A shortcut to the surface from deep in the CoC will be found at
    about D: 32. This is very handy for those who need access to the
    surface to complete quests for ultra endings, visit the Quickling
    Tree, do the Unicorn quests, etc. It is generally found two dungeon
    levels below the Casino. It is obvious because there will be two up
    staircases on the level. The shortcut causes the PC to emerge in
    Darkforge. The fact that it is close to the Casino is handy if the
    PC needs access to an aligned altar to remove dooming and/or cursing
    caused by robbing the Casino.
    <p> If the Eternal Guardian was passed peacefully by wearing the
      Ring of the High Kings, this shortcut works in both directions. If
      the Eternal Guardian was <i>not</i> passed peacefully, the
      shortcut works in the up direction only. This is a powerful
      argument for retrieving the RotHK and <i>not</i> attempting to
      pass the EG by trickery or combat.</p>

    <h3>3.15 Battle bunnies</h3>
    <pre>Battle bunny: Level: 1, DV: 16, PV: 0, Hits: 7, Attacks: 1, Damage: 3d2, Speed: 100.
Mutated battle bunny: Level: 1, DV: 16, PV: 0, Hits: 14, Attacks: 1, Damage: 3d4, Speed: 150.</pre>
    This level is found on D: 33 or D: 34. You will know when you find
    it, because the level message "You suddenly sense an intense
    tension." is generated. It consists of a long northern corridor
    connected to a long southern corridor. Traversing these corridors
    allows time for the inhabitants of the level, battle bunnies <tt>r</tt>,
    to breed. This is to be avoided as they breed like, well, rabbits.
    It can quickly get out of control. The best way to deal with the
    level is to immediately tunnel (or teleport) south by any means at
    the PC's disposal and kill Bugs, the leader of the level. This
    drastically reduces or eliminates further breeding of the bunnies.
    Kill the remainder and descend. Note that scrolls of vermin control
    do not work on the level, instead exploding to produce a green cloud
    of foul smoke.
    <p> Following are observations from David Chao:</p>
    <p> A PC who has many castings of Cure Light Wounds (or some other
      healing spell and the power points to support it reasonably, Cure
      Light Wounds is the least costly) can exploit the Battle Bunny
      level for an extremely quick and easy way to achieve L+ alignment.</p>
    <p> I'm not completely sure of the mechanics of their breeding, but
      I assume from observation that the Battle Bunnies do something in
      the context of reducing their hitpoints by half when they breed
      (needs testing from a PC that has a blessed stethescope). For
      every Battle Bunny that reproduces, you get two Battle Bunnies
      that are injured, and thus are viable for healing for lawful
      alignment boost. Once the PC is done healing a Battle Bunny, he
      can kill off each one he heals and then be surrounded by more
      injured Battle Bunnies which he can heal for even more alignment
      boosts.</p>
    <p> Try to make sure Bugs is next to you while doing this, so that
      he may be killed once the PC has no more use for rapidly breeding
      Battle Bunnies. This is especially an option to consider for high
      level Wizards, who will be guaranteed access to every spell in the
      game at the Library, including healing spells and anything else
      the PC might need to make his job easier.</p>
    <p> Using Calm Monster on the Battle Bunnies if you're trying to
      stay lawful is a silly idea because you cannot <tt>:s</tt>wap
      positions with them even if they are non-hostile.</p>
    <p> <a name="3.15.1"></a></p>
    <h4>3.15.1 Bugs, the bunny master <tt>@</tt></h4>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 50, PV: 0, Hits: 220, Attacks: 2, Damage: 1d8+18, Speed: 100.</pre>
    It is believed that the rate at which battle bunnies breed on the
    level is increased whilst Bugs is alive; so PCs are advised to kill
    him as soon as possible. He can disarm PCs in melee range, but is
    not very tough or dangerous for the stage in the game he is found
    (particularly since the PC has to defeat the Ancient Chaos Wyrm to
    get this far).

    <h3>3.16 Cat Lord <tt>f</tt></h3>
    <pre>Level: 1, DV: 60, PV: 5, Hits: 800, Attacks: 3, Damage: 4d8+8, Speed: 120.</pre>
    The Cat Lord is found on D: 35 or D: 36. The level message "This
    level somehow seems to be removed from the rest of the world." is
    generated upon entering the level. Note that teleportation is not
    allowed on the level and ceiling traps may therefore be generated.
    If the PC has killed no cats, the PC may <tt>C</tt>hat with the Cat
    Lord, in which case the following message is generated: "The cat
    lord growls: "Thou hast respected the cat race. Thus I shall grant
    upon you this gift." The cat lord suddenly is gone. Nothing but a
    tiny ring is left of him." In this case, congratulations are due.
    The PC has the most powerful ring in the game, the artifact Ring of
    the Master Cat. It is enormously helpful in the end game,
    particularly because it grants +16 to Dexterity when the PC's
    Dexterity is being destroyed by corruption. The ring's full
    properties are listed below:
    <pre>-------------- ring of the master cat [+0,+5] {Dx+16} (+16 spd) ------------------

When worn it modifies DV by +0 and PV by +5.
When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1 points of
damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d1
points of damage.

It modifies your dexterity attribute by +16.
It is very good at scoring critical hits in melee. It modifies your speed by +16.<br>
It makes Fate smile upon you.
It grants the ability to see invisible things.
</pre>
If the PC has killed cats, the Cat Lord will be hostile. His power is dependent
on the number of cats killed: he gains 10 HP for each cat killed, and 1 level
for each 25 cats killed, but max level 20.<p>

Thanks to Grey for tips on fighting the Cat Lord:</p><p>

If the PC has killed cats, the Cat Lord will be hostile. He is a very difficult opponent,
and becomes more difficult each time a cat is killed. Consequently he is worth many experience
points. PCs deperate for experience may wish to forfeit the annoying quest and ring for the
experience. The Cat Lord is vulnerable to poison, blinding, stunning, webs, paralysis, and
humanoid slaying. However, he is fast, and moves as if he's wearing seven league boots.
He also tends to be invisible, so the PC should be able to see invisible. If the PC wants
to melee him, he must be disabled. Paralysis or stunning from the spells or wands tend to
be shrugged off but will eventually work. He also shrugs Web, but will get stuck in the
webs themselves. Arrows of darkness or thunder work well, as does throwing potions of
blindness or cursed potions of invisibility. After disabling him start hammering hard
with your favorite humanoid slayer till he falls. Keep a close eye in case he breaks
out of the disability though, and keep a good healing source on standby. A few blasts from
a wand of poison can help shorten the fight a bit.</p><p>

To missile him, get him stuck in webs and pepper him full of humanoid slaying ammo that
has been dipped in poison. It can be best to lure him to a different level so you can
teleport around freely. That way you can fill a corridor with webs and keep teleporting
to each end of it, shooting at him as he keeps getting stuck.</p><p>

Bolt spells aren't greatly effective, though persistence may take him down eventually. Ball
spells work beautifully though. You can even just disable him using one of the above methods
and keep using a well charged wand of fireballs. He tends to panic fairly easily, in which
case improved fireball can be used to great effect to take him down. In this case it's best
to target the spell at a square next to him - if the center of the explosion is aimed straight
at him then he'll stop panicking and pursue the PC. Aim next to him and he'll stay covering
in a corner while being slowly roasted to death.</p><p>

If you have killed cats and just want to avoid the fearsome Cat Lord then it may be worth
luring him to another level to teleport around him, though it does mean having to put up
with a round of attacks as you go up or down the stairs.</p><p>

Note the following bug: the game uses the kill list to determine if the PC has
killed cats <i>upon entering</i> the Cat Lord's level. This means the PC can
slaughter cats indiscriminately on or below the Cat Lord's level after entering
then receive the ring.</p><p>

Also see section <a href="#0.9.2">0.9.2</a> for more on the subject.</p><p>

The Air Temple is found on a level ranging from D: 38-42, below the Casino.
The right side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is
disconnected. Entry must be made by digging. Teleportation is not allowed on
the level. Note the traps. The circumflex accent <tt>^</tt> is used to indicate secret doors.
Note the underscore in the center of the temple. This is the chaotic
elemental altar where the orb guardian is found (at least until he is
disturbed and moves). The elemental altars are very dangerous. The air
demons (or Yulgash himself) will sacrifice the PC instantly should he step on
it. The elemental altars can only be converted by champions of Balance or
Order, which means PCs going for an ultra ending cannot convert them early in
the game, before retrieving the Medal of Chaos.

The Air Temple level features intermittent electrical discharges which will
destroy both worn items and those in the pack, as well as damaging PCs without
good shock resistance or immunity. It is highly advisable to leave precious
non-artifact items on the level above or below the Air Temple. To attack the
temple, the PC must dig in then attack the monsters. The presence of the
secret doors is actually helpful, since ideally the PC can take on the monsters
outside of the temple first, without alerting the air elementals and grues.
The air elementals are very tough with many hitpoints and the ability to breathe
lightning bolts, which are another way the PC's equipment can be destroyed. The
grues and demons are troublesome because they have a corrupting melee attack that
has a very high to-hit. Even PCs with very good DV will be hit by them eventually
- a good reason to develop the PC's missile weapon skills. Invisibility is
tremendously useful. Only the chaos servants and Yulgash see invisible.<p>

<pre>Level: 1, DV: 24, PV: 8, Hits: 600, Attacks: 1, Damage: 1d50, Speed: 100.</pre>
As befits his name, Yulgash is liable to summon anything up to and including
great wyrms and ancient karmic dragons. Killing him as soon as he is aware of
the PCs presence is therefore a top priority. Yulgash is able to teleport if not
on a level that prohibits it (such as the Air Temple itself), is immune to
lightning, has a corrupting melee attack, but otherwise he is NOT a spellcaster.
He is vulnerable to humanoid slayers.<p>

Yulgash holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Air, greater identified as follows:
</p><pre>------------------ Chaos Orb of Elemental Air {Dx+10} -------------------------

It is an artifact.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 2d9+3 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3
points of damage.

It modifies your dexterity attribute by +10.

To attack the temple, the PC must dig in then attack the monsters.
All of the monsters here with the exception of stone golems
and chaos servants are able to travel through stone, so in practice the
PC will probably be attacked before penetrating the walls of the temple.
Stone snakes are poisonous, stone grues have a corrupting melee attack
and earth elementals throw rocks, apparently using slings which are often
left behind when they are killed. Earth elementals have many hitpoints
and regenerate. Exact statistics for earth elementals and stone grues
are not available from a blessed stethoscope - the game responds that the
monster "rather seems to be a piece of furniture." The monster memory
states that earth elementals have about 210 hitpoints, stone grues about
240 hitpoints. They both have a PV of 40, so use a powerful melee
attack or they will take forever to kill. All of these monsters will
fall to brute force or magic.<p>

Attacking the Ancient Stone Beast may seem like attacking a wall of granite.
Not fast, not overwhelming PV, but it can take a formidable amount
of bashing to bring down this creature. Not helping matters is the fact
that it regenerates wounds and has a corrupting melee attack. It is vulnerable
to demon slayers.<p>

The Ancient Stone Beast holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Earth, greater identified as follows:

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 3d9+3 points

<h3>3.19 Unreal Caves</h3>
The Unreal Cave system is a sub-dungeon, the entrance to which is found on D:46 or D:47.
It has six levels, contains the Mana Temple and its own sub-dungeon, the Blue Dragon Caves.
It is a very high danger level area, home to the game's most dangerous monsters and a vicious
corruption rate. All PCs are required to enter the Unreal Cave system in order to access the
Mana Temple on the lowest level. Vaults cannot be generated in this area.<p>

<a name="3.19.1"></a></p>
<h4>3.19.1 Sharad Waador, the ancient karmic wyrm <tt>W</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 60, PV: 60, Hits: 1080, Attacks: 3, Damage: 9d12+12, Speed: 120.</pre>
Note that ancient karmic wyrms are wishable. Although they have powerful breath attacks
of all elemental varieties, a dangerous melee attack, rapid regeneration, and immunity to
all elemental attacks, they're critically vulnerable to invisibility, and thus may be
killed by an invisible PC bombarding them repeatedly with magic missiles. They are worth a
lot of experience when killed.<p>

Sharad-Waador is found on level 4, standing next to the stairs leading to the Blue Dragon Caves.
He is nonhostile and will assign a quest to kill an ancient
blue wyrm, Srraxxarrakex, who is his mortal enemy. This is a
difficult quest and is in no way necessary to finish the game.
Part of the difficulty is the presence of Srraxxarrakex's children:
many different blue dragons including ancient blue dragons which
see invisible. Blue dragons breathe lightning bolts, which will
damage a PC without very good resistance or immunity as well as
destroying items, both worn and in the pack. There is no way to
prevent the item destruction (though high Alertness, Dodge, DV,
Luck and lightning resistance/immunity helps).
Items can be left in Sharad-Waador's
room for safekeeping while on the quest. Sharad-Waador does not
move unless he is attacked or the PC reneges on the deal to take
the quest.</p><p>

To receive the quest, the PC must first decide what equipment will
be left behind, drop it, stand on the down staircase in
Sharad-Waador's room, then <tt>C</tt>hat with him. This sequence of events
is necessary because Sharad-Waador will not chat with the PC until
the PC is on the down stairs, and after chatting with the PC demands
that the PC descend immediately. If the PC moves off the staircase
at this point, Sharad-Waador becomes hostile. A trick that can be
used is leaving some of the PC's precious but 'might be needed'
equipment <i>on</i> the stairway. Sharad-Waador does not become hostile
if the PC emerges from the Blue Dragon Caves without moving from the
stairway. This provides a means of protecting very valuable
equipment (such as scrolls of chaos resistance) that might be needed
to save the PC's life. Despite the fact that Sharad-Waador does not
see invisible, he will detect an invisible PC that emerges from the
Blue Dragon Caves without killing Srraxxarakex and become hostile
if the PC moves from the stairs.</p><p>

The main reason for taking this quest however, is because Sharad-Waador
rewards the PC with a huge pile of equipment for completing it. Among
this equipment, which generally does not contain anything remarkable,
is the artifact dagger Needle.
</p><pre>----------- black rune-covered dagger "Needle" (+8, 3d4) [+4, +1] ----------

Weight: 10s

When worn it modifies DV by +4 and PV by +1.

When used in melee combat it grants a +8 bonus to hit and causes 3d4 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +8 bonus to hit and causes 3d4
points of damage.

(Sting has the same base properties, but Needle + Sting grant +50 to hit and
damage when dual-wielded)
</pre>
Be very careful with this pile of
equipment. Needle is indistinguishable from ordinary daggers until it
is identified. It is best to have a blessed scroll of identify at the
ready, to identify all the treasure the PC has taken from the Blue
Dragon Caves and the heap of stuff Sharad-Waador provides. The junk can
then be safely dropped without risking misplacing Needle. When Needle
is combined with its twin, the artifact dagger Sting, held by the
Assassin Prince, they become the most powerful weapons in the game, at
least in terms of raw to-hit and to-damage. If a PC planning an Ultra
Ending makes it this far, check section <a href="#2.11.3.1">2.11.3.1</a>
and get the Filk quest from the Assassin Prince. He can then be killed
for Sting, if desired.<p>

<h3>3.20 Blue Dragon Caves</h3>
Blue Dragon Caves is the name commonly given to a five level dungeon found
deep in the Caverns of Chaos. It is entered from a staircase found on the fourth
level of the Unreal Caves (the one that Sharad-Waador is found standing beside);
making it a side-branch of a side-branch of the caverns. It is referred to as
"some ancient dragon caves" in the death log, and uses the shorthand "DL" ingame.<p>

All five levels of the Blue Dragon Caves are cavernous, meaning they have a high
monster generation rate and a lot of open space. Unsurprisingly, there are a
lot of blue dragons found in the caves. Blue baby dragons appear on the first level,
whilst blue dragons and ancient blue dragons appear on deeper levels. In addition
to the many varied blue dragons found in these caves, other nasty
high level monsters may be found here, including chaos wizards, greater titans and
greater molochs, for example. It is wise to have some means of
dealing with greater molochs along, whether it is simply speed for
running away, phase daggers or demon slayers. High speed is
virtually essential for killing Srraxxarrakex, as well.</p><p>

Upon entering the fifth and final level of the caves, the following
message is generated: "These ancient caves are covered with marks
from huge reptiles... hundreds of such marks." The final level contains only blue dragons
and great blue wyrms. Srraxxarrakex will be found on this level.</p><p>

When the Blue Dragon Caves were first implemented, there were
complaints that the quest was impossible due to the item destruction.
The amount of item destruction has been toned down a bit, and some players
will actually scum these caves because
killing the blue dragons generates large amounts of valuable equipment,
sometimes including very valuable items such as scrolls of chaos
resistance or rings of djinni summoning.</p><p>

<h4>3.20.1 Srraxxarrakex, the ancient blue wyrm <tt>W</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 60, PV: 40, Hits: 924, Attacks: 3, Damage: 8d8+12, Speed: 120.</pre>
Sraxxarrakex is a very powerful ancient blue wyrm, more powerful than
any other ancient wyrm in the game. He is, as might be expected,
immune to shock. One of the things that makes him so difficult to
defeat is the fact that he naturally regenerates <i>and</i> casts powerful
healing spells at the same time. He has three attacks per round, so
he can, for instance, breathe a lightning bolt, attack in melee, cast
heal, while still getting natural regeneration <i>per round</i>.
He can also confuse the PC from a distance.
The PC must be capable of dealing massive amounts of damage
quickly in order to defeat him. He can be attacked in almost any way,
including melee, missiles and magic. He is of course vulnerable to
dragon slaying missiles and melee weapons.<p>

The Mana Temple is found on its own level, MT, the last level of the
UL, the Unreal Cave system. The UL is a side branch off the main CoC
at D: 46 or D: 47.
The left side of the level is random. Note that the temple itself is
disconnected. Entry must be made by digging. Teleportation does not
work on this level. The walls of the Mana Temple itself are
undiggable. It must be entered through the single square room at the
southwest of the Temple. Note the traps completely surrounding the
Temple. Ceiling traps replace teleportation traps in the Mana Temple.
The numeral <tt>1</tt> is used to indicate secret doors. Note the underscore
in the eastern center of the temple. This is the chaotic elemental
altar where the orb guardian is found (at least until he is disturbed
and moves). The standard warning about standing on altars applies -
many of the monsters are capable of speech and will sacrifice the PC.
The elemental altars can only be converted by champions of Balance or
Order, which means PCs going for an ultra ending cannot convert them
early in the game, before retrieving the Medal of Chaos.

To attack the temple, the PC must travel through the trap-filled
tunnel around the temple. During this, the magebane eyes and
magedoom eyes will be draining the power points of the PC.
Classes which are dependent on power points are well advised to
bring along blessed scrolls of power. If possible, a wand of trap
detection should be saved for the Mana Temple. This is a much
faster way of detecting the traps than using the Detect Traps skill,
especially when combined with the Farsight spell or a necklace of
the eye. The faster this tunnel is traversed, the less time the
eyes have to drain the PP of the PC. The Mana Temple ranks with
the nastiest places in the game. Many players do not enter the
temple itself, instead staying in the corridor. Using this
technique, the monsters can be fought one at a time. Even so,
the chaos wizards are summoners, so the PC can still be surrounded
by summoned monsters in the corridor. The objective using this
method is to wait for Nuurag-Vaarn to exit the temple, kill him,
collect the Orb and flee.<p>

<h4>3.21.1 Nuurag-Vaarn, the Chaos Archmage <tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 60, PV: 30, Hits: 906, Attacks: 2, Damage: 2d10+6, Speed: 120.</pre>
Nuurag-Vaarn is a difficult opponent, to say the least. He has
a corrupting melee attack. He is very fond of casting spells,
especially Death Ray, Darkness, and Invisibility. Entering the Mana Temple
without a means of death ray resistance is virtual suicide.
Since the Ancient Mummy Wrapping provides both Death Ray resistance and the
See Invisible intrinsic, it is a logical armor choice while in the Mana Temple.
Nuurag-Vaarn is also very good at confusing the PC, cursing, and is an attribute drainer.
In fact he has access to all spells available to monsters except healing.
He is immune to elemental attacks other than acid. He is
vulnerable to humanoid slaying ammo; this is a good way to attack
him if the PC can maintain a clear shot at him through all the
monsters, summoned and otherwise, in the temple.<p>

To summarize the prerequisites needed to fight Nuurag-Vaarn:
</p><ol type="1"><li>death ray resistance - essential
</li><li>confusion resistance - essential
</li><li>light source - essential
</li><li>See Invisible intrinsic - recommended
</li><li>fire, cold, lightning resistance - recommended
</li><li>humanoid slaying ammo - recommended
</li></ol><p>

Nuurag-Vaarn holds the Chaos Orb of Elemental Mana, greater identified as follows:
</p><pre>---------------------- Chaos Orb of Elemental Mana {Ma+10} --------------------

It is an artifact.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d16+3 points
of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d10+3
points of damage.

It modifies your mana attribute by +10.
</pre>
(full PP, +3 Mana, corruption when <tt>U</tt>sed)<p>

<h3>3.22 D: 48 - Elemental Anomalies</h3>
Warning: following the procedures on this page is irreversible. The PC cannot
return to the higher levels of the CoC. Have everything you will need with
you before proceeding.<p>

Level 48 of the Caverns of Chaos contains five elemental anomalies corresponding
to the five Chaos Orbs. They are guarded by four elemental grues with the usual
corrupting grue melee attack. The mana anomaly is not guarded by a grue, but
rather a chaos wizard. The idea here is to <tt>U</tt>se each Chaos Orb while standing
on the appropriate elemental anomaly. A transcript of the results and some
remarks follow:</p><p>

<a name="3.22.1"></a></p>
<h4>3.22.1 Mana anomaly - green underscore <tt>_</tt></h4>
<pre>You face a strange small rift in the air leading into unknown dimensions of pure energy.
Do you want to drop the blessed Chaos Orb of Elemental Mana into the rift? [y/N]
You drop the blessed Chaos Orb of Elemental Mana into the strange rift.
For some seconds a strange silence fills the whole level.
Suddenly the rift disappears.
</pre>
Using the mana orb in this way causes the PC's power points to drop to zero
and a loss of two points of the Mana attribute. For this reason, spellcasters
may want to do this anomaly first, to allow the maximum time for PP to
regenerate. Blessed scrolls of power are very useful here.<p>

<a name="3.22.2"></a></p>
<h4>3.22.2 Earth anomaly - brown underscore <tt>_</tt></h4>
<pre>You face a man-high stone column with a round opening in the center.
Do you want to put the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Earth {To+10} into the hole? [y/N]
You fit the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Earth {To+10} into the stone column.
For some seconds the whole level is shaking.
Suddenly the column disappears.
</pre>
The shaking of the level seems to imply some sort of minor earthquake, but
the level takes no damage as a result.<p>

<a name="3.22.3"></a></p>
<h4>3.22.3 Water anomaly - blue underscore <tt>_</tt></h4>
<pre>You face a shimmering pool of unknown depth.
Do you want to throw the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Water {Wi+10} into shimmering pool? [y/N]
You throw the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Water {Wi+10} into the shimmering pool.
For some seconds the air gets very humid on this level.
Suddenly the humidity dispenses and everything is normal once more.
</pre>
The humidity generated by this operation will damage anything vulnerable to
water damage - be careful, have waterproof blankets, do not have unprotected
iron armor or weapons exposed.<p>

<a name="3.22.4"></a></p>
<h4>3.22.4 Air anomaly - bright blue underscore <tt>_</tt></h4>
<pre>You face a man-high whirlwind rising out of a hole in the ground.
Do you want to throw the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Air {Dx+10} into the whirlwind? [y/N]
You throw the uncursed Chaos Orb of Elemental Air {Dx+10} into the whirlwind.
For some seconds a roaring wind soars through this level.
Suddenly everything is silent and the whirlwind disappears.
</pre>
This roaring wind seems to do no damage.<p>

<a name="3.22.5"></a></p>
<h4>3.22.5 Fire anomaly - red underscore <tt>_</tt></h4>
<pre>You face a man-high bonfire.
Do you want to throw the blessed Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire {St+10} into the roaring bonfire? [y/N]
You throw the blessed Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire {St+10} into the bonfire.
For some seconds the whole level is filled with an immense heat. You resist the searing flames.
Suddenly the level cools down once more and the bonfire is gone.
</pre>
The fire anomaly is by far the most dangerous. It will damage anything
vulnerable to fire. This includes any monsters that may be wandering the
level. That includes cats. It is very disappointing and frustrating to
kill a cat in this way and have the hard-fought-for Ring of the Master
Cat explode at this point. Zap a wand of monster detection or read a
scroll of monster detection before using the fire orb in the anomaly.
It also damages a Necromancer PC's slaves. It may not kill them, but
undead are vulnerable to fire damage, and a partially fried and very
angry extremely experienced level 110 quickling king lich is not something
the PC wants to worry about at this point. Leave undead slaves on D: 47.
Pets, companions and slaves cannot cross D: 49 anyway.<p>

<a name="3.22.6"></a></p>
<h4>3.22.6 Descending</h4>
After all of the orbs are in their proper places, the PC receives the following message:
<pre>You hear a grating sound in the distance.
</pre>
This means the up staircase has reversed direction and now points down.
There is no way to return to D: 47 at this point. The PC is now committed
to going through D: 49 to D: 50, either to win or die.<p>

<h3>3.23 D: 49 - Frictionless Ice</h3>
Level 49 of the Caverns of Chaos is called the frictionless level by many
players. It is covered with ice that is too slippery to cross by normal
means. Spiked boots do not help. Teleportation fails on this level.
Since the ice is (almost) frictionless, throwing objects will propel the
PC in the opposite direction (remember freshman physics?). There is also
a special gift available on this level. If the PC equips a potion of
uselessness in the missile slot and throws it, a deity rewards the PC for
finding a use for the potion with a random artifact. Note that the potion
must actually propel the PC in order for this to work, so don't throw your
only potion of uselessness in the wrong direction! The following messages
are typical of those generated upon entering and throwing a potion of uselessness:
<pre>There is a stair leading downwards here.
You climb downwards...
The ground seems to be covered with a very slippery layer of ice. It's cold
here! There is a stair leading upwards here.
[T]arget -- [Z] Abort. (x2)
The uncursed potion of uselessness thuds into an obstacle. The uncursed potion
of uselessness shatters! You slide to the west. You suddenly hear a booming
voice!
"*YE REALLY HAST FOUND A USE FOR THIS PETTY ITEM*"
"*YER INGENUITY SHALL BE REWARDED*"
Something is lying before you. Out of ammunition.
Reload with the heap of 14 uncursed rocks (+1, 1d4)? ([y]es, [n]o, [q]uit) Q
Blessed shining silver bracers (10s) are lying here. You shudder. You resist
the icy blast.
You pick up the blessed shining silver bracers. You sneeze. You resist the icy
blast.
</pre>

This particular PC was very lucky and received the Bracers of War. As
mentioned the artifact is random and can be potentially worthless. Note the
cold-related messages. This is troublesome for Drakelings, who will find
themselves frozen nearly solid. A reduction in speed to 10 is typical.
If the player is aware of this, it is not a huge problem. Upon entering CoC
49, cast Improved Fireball adjacent to the PC or zap a wand of fire at the
PC's location repeatedly until speed is reasonable again.<p>

Monsters cannot be wished for, Necromancy cannot be applied, and reading scrolls
of familiar summoning doesn't work on D: 49. However, in 1.1.1, <tt>u</tt>sing figurines
and djinni appearing from non-blessed RoDS work normally. Monsters created in this manner
have no trouble walking on the ice.</p><p>

The following map shows the results of using rocks and a sling to travel
through CoC 49. Note the rocks are closer together in the final central
corridor. This was deliberately done to show the results changing when the
PC switched from a sling of the long shot to a normal sling. Use whatever
is handy, effective and expendable to travel through CoC 49 - rocks, arrows,
guaranteed returning missiles such as a boomerang, even that worthless pile
of sis the PC has been dragging around forever. Do NOT use missile
weapons that are not guaranteed to return such as the rune-covered trident
or the Hammer of the Gods. Given the nature of CoC 49, the PC may never be
able to stop exactly where they fell to retrieve them.</p><p>

The walls of D: 49 are diggable with the Mystic Shovel spell, a wand of
digging, a pickaxe, the Elementalist class power and a Monk's kicking
ability. Monks using their ability will be propelled backward one square,
and the rock may or may not shatter, making this technique somewhat awkward.
The newly dug area remains too slippery to cross. This offers Drakelings
a potentially faster way through D: 49.

Level 50 of the Caverns of Chaos is the final battleground for those not
attempting an ultra ending. It is appropriately challenging. The Mana
Temple will have provided an idea of what CoC 50 will be like for PCs that
make it this far.</p>

The right side of the level is random. Note the dungeon features. The <tt>&amp;</tt>
symbols in this map do not represent demons but rather levers. These control
the state of the Chaos Gate, represented by the <tt>8</tt> in the large central room.
These features cannot be seen in the color map.</p><p>

Note that all of the <tt>&amp;</tt> symbols in the color map <i>do</i> represent balors - there
are balors standing on the levers.</p><p>

There are two basic ways to finish CoC 50: The object of the level is to
<tt>h</tt>andle both of the levers, thus closing the Chaos Gate and ending the
incursion of chaos into Ancardia (that is, the background corruption). This can initially be accomplished by
clearing the northern and southern corridors and <tt>h</tt>andling the levers.
However, some of the monsters on CoC 50 are intelligent enough to reopen
the gate. To ensure that the levers remain in their closed position, the
PC has two choices: ensure the levers remain in their closed position
forever, or make sure the following intelligent monsters are all dead:
Fistanarius, balors, ghost lords and chaos wizards.</p><p>

A third alternative is available for those PCs who aspire to a special
ending, which require Chaos Gate entry. Much of the combat on D: 50 can be
bypassed as soon as it is possible to teleport to the location of the Chaos
Gate. In order to do this, Fistanarius must move from
his position on top of the Chaos Gate. See section <a href="#4">4</a> Special Endings, for
more about the (extensive) requirements for attempting a special ending.</p><p>

<a name="3.24.1"></a></p>
<h4>3.24.1 Fistanarius, the greater balor <tt>&amp;</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 80, PV: 40, Hits: 1000, Attacks: 2, Damage: 8d12+20, Speed: 100.</pre>
Fistanarius is a unique boss monster found in front of the Chaos Gate. He is the last boss that most
players going for a standard ending are likely to face. Since it is
possible to keep the Gate closed by destroying the two levers completely, it is actually possible to
complete the game without running into the greater balor at all.<p>

Like all balors Fistanarius has strong, corrupting attacks, teleports, and can summon random monsters
of appropriate danger level. His only mode of attack is melee, meaning that Archers with blessed ammo
of demon or humanoid slaying should be powerful enough by such stage to deal large amounts of damage
to him relatively riskfree. Non-fire magic also works on him (despite what his monster memory description says).</p><p>

PCs taking him on in melee range need to take extreme care against his multiple attacks, as they
are not only accurate and incredibly powerful but also highly corrupting - 3 or 4 attacks from
the greater balor alone seem to be enough to grant the PC one new corruption, at a point in the game
where background corruption alone is a huge concern. PCs who survive his attacks may find themselves
eventually being corrupted to death, if not careful.</p><p>

<a name="3.24.2"></a></p>
<h4>3.24.2 Wands of destruction ending</h4>
One relatively easy way to finish CoC 50 is to use wands of destruction.
This, and the variation using wands of door creation / monster creation
below, require substantially less combat than a traditional ending. The
level is usually diggable, so it is usually possible to tunnel into the
northern and southern corridors and clear them. If not, the PC is in for
some more work. Remember they are closed by secret
doors. During this, some of the intelligent monsters may sense what is
happening - ghost lords may pass through the walls, balors may teleport in.
When both corridors are cleared, <tt>h</tt>andle one of the levers to close it.
<tt>z</tt>ap a wand of destruction to destroy it in its closed state. This will open
the walls to the large central room and make all of those monsters pursue
the PC. Teleport to the other lever, <tt>h</tt>andle it to close it and <tt>z</tt>ap a
wand of destruction to destroy it. Teleport to the up staircase and leave.
You've won. Here is an example of what the level might look like after
doing this:

</pre>
Note most of the balors, but not Fistanarius, have teleported to search for
the PC. The chaos mutants in the center, the greater chaos servants in the
central corridor, the writhing masses of primal chaos and most of the ghost
lords have not even moved.<p>

<a name="3.24.3"></a></p>
<h4>3.24.3 Wands of door creation / monster creation ending</h4>
This is a variation on the above technique. It is somewhat safer in that the
big room never has to be opened at all, but both wands of door creation with
at least six total charges and a wand of monster creation with two charges
are required.<p>

This method starts with the same approach as outlined above - clear the
northern and southern corridors after entering them by digging. Zap a wand of
door creation twice to almost enclose one of the levers. Handle the lever to
close it. Zap a wand of monster creation to create a monster on the closed
lever to prevent balors from teleporting to that space. Zap a wand of door
creation to trap the monster on that square. Teleport to the other lever and
repeat. Teleport to the stairs and leave.</p><p>

This method has some problems, as does the wands of destruction ending above.
Regardless, they are much, much easier than the alternative of killing the
intelligent monsters on the level. First, some monsters will open doors, so it
may be necessary to keep zapping, killing the monster and repeating until
something suitable is generated. Locking the door will solve this problem if
the PC has an appropriate key, which he should by this time. Second, you must
be quick, which is why teleportation is recommended. It is quite likely that
the balors will start teleporting to investigate the levers, and they are quite
capable of opening the doors or smashing them if locked, killing the monster
standing on the lever and reactivating the lever. Third is simply a philosophical
problem. The PC has not really fulfilled the requirements for winning, but is
taking advantage of the fact that the level will remain frozen after he leaves.
Nonetheless, the game counts this as a win.</p><p>

<a name="3.24.4"></a></p>
<h4>3.24.4 Paragon of Order</h4>
The Paragon of Order is one of the most difficult and frustrating challenges available.
In order to become Paragon of Order, the player must arrive at D:50 as crowned champion of law,
without having committed any chaotic acts (meaning alignment must have never dropped) or allowing any
lawful monsters to die. The last requirement is particularly vexing: it is not simply
that lawful monsters cannot be killed by the PC similar to dealing with cats, but rather
that no lawful creature may be killed at all, even if they are attacked by another
creature or destroyed by a floor trap. The reward for completing this arduous task
is the most powerful artifact girdle in the game, the Platinum Girdle.
<pre>--- platinum girdle "True Strength" (+3, +0) [+18, +9] {Wi+15} (+15 spd) ---

Weight: 20s

When worn it modifies DV by +18 and PV by +9.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d2+3
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and
causes 1d2 points of damage.

It increases your luck.
It causes your wounds to regenerate.
It modifies your willpower attribute by +15.
It modifies your speed by +15.
It grants resistance to poison.
It grants luck.
It makes Fate smile upon you.
It grants resistance to death attacks.
It grants resistance to confusion attacks.
</pre>
Since the PC has practically finished the game by the time the artifact is received,
acquiring it is more a point of pride for players than anything else. Note that if
the player commits a chaotic act after becoming Paragon, True Strength will slowly
squeeze the PC to death: the girdle becomes cursed when this happens, and cannot be
removed by any means - uncursing it will only result in immediate recursing. It does
8d6 damage, and reduces Dexterity by 1 for each squeeze.<p>
<small>
In v1.2.0 only lawful deaths that are caused by the PC will be counted against the quest.

<h3>4 Special endings</h3>
<a name="4.1"></a>
<h4>4.1 Andor Drakon, the ElDeR cHaOs GoD <tt>@</tt></h4>
<pre>Level: 1, DV: 80, PV: 50, Hits: 10200, Attacks: 3, Damage: 5d10+24, Speed: 200.</pre>
Andor Drakon is the source of all the trouble in
Ancardia. He resides on the ChAoS plane, which lies beyond the Chaos
Gate. Any PC who wants to attempt a special ending will have to face
him. The requirements for passing through the Chaos Gate vary according
to alignment and whether the PC wants to attempt the normal chaos god
ending or an ultra ending, and are detailed in the sections regarding
the endings.<p>

It is a good idea to remove the Chaos artifacts necessary for gate passage
immediately upon arrival on the ChAoS plane. Furthermore, drop them.
They are no longer needed and only serve to further corrupt the PC, which
is going to happen rapidly anyway because of the corrupting nature of the
ChAoS plane. Read all scrolls of chaos resistance. Drink all potions of
cure corruption.</p><p>

Andor Drakon is, as might be imagined, a formidable enemy. He is beyond description,
as the monster memory states. We'll try to describe him anyway.
He is invisible. He casts what are apparently Death Rays, has
a corrupting melee attack in addition to the naturally corrupting Chaos
Plane, paralyzes, confuses, summons (writhing masses of primal chaos and chaos servants are a favorite),
casts Darkness, teleports, and drains attributes and power points at a fearsome rate.
Additionally, he sees invisible, sees in darkness, and can pass through walls.</p><p>

How to deal with him? Have a massively powerful melee attack. Drink all attribute
boosting potions prior to gate entry. Be very, very fast, the faster the better,
preferably speed should be intrinsically above 200 and boosted above 400. Have
excellent PV and DV. Have every resistance possible - death ray, paralysation and
confusion resistances are absolutely necessary. If the PC is not paralyzation resistant,
an amulet of free action (or the Boots of the Divine Messenger, for
instance) is essential. A light source is essential. He is vulnerable to demon
and humanoid slaying weapons and ammo. If the PC sticks with missiles, Andor
Drakon cannot corrupt by touch, paralyze or drain attributes. If the PC is out of
direct line his Death Rays cannot be used.</p><p>

He has been killed in many different ways, including using the Acid Ball spell.
Relying on spells on the ChAoS plane is not recommended, since Andor Drakon
drains PP very rapidly and claims that using magic strengthens him. In practice
casting spells makes him faster (speed +spellcost/5). A wand of fireballs or
crystals of fire are handy for removing the hordes of writhing masses of
primal chaos he will probably summon.</p><p>

Chaotics should avoid prayer on the ChAoS plane. It causes greater balors to be summoned.</p><p>

If a PC has much trouble on D: 50, it does not bode well as far as
defeating Andor Drakon goes. He often defeats PCs who have <i>no</i>
trouble on D: 50 (but are perhaps not as spoiled as those reading this).</p><p>

Monsters generated on the ChAoS Plane are:
chaos brother,
chaos sister,
chaos warlord,
chaos warrior,
corruptor,
writhing mass of primal chaos (quadruple chance),
chaos plague bearer,
chaos rat,

<h4>4.2 Chaos God ending</h4>
The Chaos God ending was the first special ending available in ADOM, as of gamma 6 (?).
Today it has become kind of old-fashioned. Victory posts with "ordinary" Chaos Gods
are few and far between. One reason it has fallen out of favor is because the future
history of the PC after winning is bleak: after going to all the trouble necessary to
even meet, much less defeat Andor Drakon, the PC revels in his glory for some time but
is ultimately vanquished by a Champion of Law. Still, it is the only means of
accessing a special ending if Khelavaster cannot be saved, which is very difficult.
It is also the only way to achieve a special ending with a pure chaotic: a PC that
starts chaotic and stays that way for the entire game. That in itself is quite an
accomplishment.<p>

<a name="4.2.1"></a></p>
<h4>4.2.1 Requirements</h4>
In order to achieve the Chaos God ending the PC must meet several requirements. These are
checked during passage through the Chaos Gate. He must be C-. He must be a crowned Champion
of Chaos. He must be extremely corrupted (the game will inform you when the PC is extremely
corrupted). If these criteria are not met, the PC is shredded to pieces by any of several
guardians or the millions of Chaos denizens Andor Drakon has collected (the exact guardian
who kills the PC will have to wait for further testing, however, from memory, it is something
like multi-tentacled horrors of unspeakable might check C- alignment, a chaos knight checks
for crowned Champion of Chaos and says "I bow before thee, my lord!" if the requirement is
met and the millions of Chaos denizens check the requirement for extremely corrupted; a
successful check causes them to chant "One of us! One of us!"). Further, the PC must have
the Chaos Trinity properly equipped: wear the Crown and Medal of Chaos, wield the Sceptre
of Chaos in the right hand, leave the left hand empty. If this requirement is not met, Andor
Drakon blasts the PC to oblivion. A successful check results in a message from Andor Drakon
along the lines of "You seem to be wearing the insignia correctly. iT wIlL bE a PlEaSuRe To
ShReD yOu In MeLeE!" If all of this is met, the PC winds up on the ChAoS plane to face Andor
Drakon. Despite the fact that wielding the Sceptre of Chaos is required for Gate entry, in
ADOM 1.1.1 it is not necessary for the PC to be wielding it when Andor Drakon is killed
(unlike the TotRR in the ultra endings below). Since it is a corrupting artifact, it may
be wise to discard it immediately upon arrival on the ChAoS plane.<p>

<a name="4.2.2"></a></p>
<h4>4.2.2 Chaos God ending step by step</h4>
<ul><li>While chaotic, give six artifacts to the Demented Ratling and get the location of the Stone Circle - <a href="#3.5.8">3.5.8</a>.
</li><li>Go to the Stone Circle and kill the multi-headed chaos dragon and get the Crown of Chaos - <a href="#2.17">2.17</a>.
</li><li>While chaotic, talk to the old crone and give her the following items: a giant boar skull, a scroll of danger,
a potion of cure corruption, a wand of monster creation, and a farmer corpse. Receive the Medal of Chaos - <a href="#2.1.6">2.1.6</a>.
</li><li>Kill MaLaKaI on level 66 of the Infinite Dungeon, and get the Sceptre of Chaos - <a href="#2.2.2">2.2.2</a>.
</li><li>Get crowned as champion of Chaos.
</li><li>Fight your way to the Chaos Gate on D:50 - <a href="#3.24">3.24</a>.
</li><li>Be extremely corrupted (16 or more corruptions).
</li><li>While wearing the Crown of Chaos and the Medal of Chaos, and wielding the Sceptre of Chaos, enter the Chaos Gate.
</li><li>Kill Andor Drakon - <a href="#4.1">4.1</a>.
</li></ul><p>

<a name="4.3"></a></p>
<h4>4.3 Ultra endings</h4>
The Ultra endings were available as of gamma ten. In this gamma, the restriction on Chaos Gate
entry for chaotics only was removed. However, the PC needs to have a mythical and long searched-for
weapon - the Trident of the Red Rooster (TotRR). The steps necessary to obtain it are listed below.<p>

All PCs attempting an Ultra ending must procure the Crown of Chaos and Medal of Chaos. In order
to receive the quests for the Medal of Chaos from Gaab'Baay the PC must be at some flavor of chaotic
alignment. There are six quests total, the first of which is to "satisfy the mutated one" which refers
to completing the Demented Ratling's demand for six artifacts. The Demented Ratling will also only talk
to chaotics. The Demented Ratling reveals the secret of the Stone Circle, where Keriax, the multi-headed
chaos dragon who holds the Crown of Chaos resides. After receiving the Medal of Chaos, the PC is free to
change alignment, since the Stone Circle can be entered regardless of alignment. Remember the PC must
change back to at least some flavor of neutral alignment in order to retrieve the TotRR. Khelavaster
will not summon the TotRR for chaotics.</p><p>

All of the above has another implication - the PC cannot be crowned until the Medal of Chaos (or the TotRR
itself, if an Ultimate Chaos God ending is planned) is obtained. Fallen champions will never receive the
TotRR nor survive passage through the Chaos Gate, so the nice benefits of crowning must be deferred until
the Medal of Chaos or TotRR are obtained.</p><p>

<a name="4.3.1"></a></p>
<h4>4.3.1 Trident of the Red Rooster <tt>(</tt></h4>
The Trident of the Red Rooster is the ultimate weapon available.
<pre>------- Trident of the Red Rooster (+36, 6d12+18) [+12, +12] {Ma+24} -------

Weight: 150s

When worn it modifies DV by +12 and PV by +12.

When used in melee combat it grants a +36 bonus to hit and causes 6d12+18
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +8 bonus to hit and
causes 9d8+16 points of damage.

It is an undead slayer.
It is a demon slayer.
It modifies your mana attribute by +24.
This weapon returns when thrown.
It grants resistance to death attacks.
It grants the ability to see invisible things.
It grants immunity to fire.
It grants immunity to acid.
It grants immunity to cold attacks.
It grants immunity to shock attacks.
It grants the ability to breathe water.
</pre>
It allows passage through the Chaos Gate regardless of alignment. Retrieving it is a lengthy process
outlined below.<p>

<a name="4.3.1.1"></a></p>
<h4>4.3.1.1 Filk <tt>p</tt> quest</h4>
The Filk quest is available from the Assassin Prince, on behalf of the Mad Minstrel,
once three requirements are met. They are: the PC is at least experience level 45
(Assassins are exception, they must only be at least level 30), the
PC has successfully taken Sharad-Waador's quest and slain Srraxxarrakex and the PC has
in his possession the artifact dagger Needle which is one of the rewards Sharad-Waador
provides for killing Srraxxarrakex. After receiving the quest, the PC may elect to kill
the Assassin Prince since he carries Needle's companion dagger Sting. Dual-wielded,
they are enormously powerful. The object of the quest is to kill Filk, a named quickling
bard.<p>

The Assassin Prince gives some cryptic hints provided by the Mad Minstrel about Filk's
location. They mean that Filk can be found on the level of the ID corresponding to the
number of first-killed monsters killed. Note that this number can change as the quest
proceeds. As a quickling, he is obviously fast, but Filk is the fastest of them all
with a speed of 1500. When attacking Filk, note two things: he has the highest DV of
any monster in the game at 500 but a PV of zero. Needless to say he is difficult to hit.
However, once he is hit he is easily killed. He also shares the properties of karmics,
although he is not named as such. Use missiles, wands, spells, Mindcraft or companions
to kill him.</p><p>

<a name="4.3.1.2"></a></p>
<h4>4.3.1.2 Mad Minstrel <tt>@</tt></h4>
After the Filk quest is completed, the PC should visit the Mad Minstrel. He will
provide access to and information about the location of the Scintillating Cave (found
in the western part of the wilderness south of the RotHK caves very close to the Ruined
City).<p>

<a name="4.3.1.3"></a></p>
<h4>4.3.1.3 Crumpled scroll <tt>?</tt></h4>
The crumpled scroll is held by the Emperor Moloch on the last level of Scintillating
Cave. See section <a href="#2.20">2.20</a> for more details.<p>

<a name="4.3.1.4"></a></p>
<h4>4.3.1.4 Khelavaster in Terinyo</h4>
At this stage in the game Khelavaster can be found in Terinyo. He is invisible. When
given the crumpled scroll, he will summon the TotRR. Remember the PC must be of
neutral or lawful alignment.<p>

<a name="4.3.2"></a></p>
<h4>4.3.2 Avatar of Order ending</h4>
To finish this ending the following requirements must be met: the PC enters the Chaos Gate
as a crowned L+ Champion of Law wearing the Crown and Medal of Chaos and wielding the TotRR.
The PC must not be intrinsically doomed or cursed other than due to wearing the Chaos artifacts.
There is no corruption requirement. Kill Andor Drakon while wielding the TotRR. If the TotRR
is not wielded when Andor Drakon dies, the ChAoS energies released by his death overwhelm the
PC, turning him into a miserable ChAoS wretch. Avoid this. ;-)<p>

Note that it is possible for
a prospective Avatar of Order to become a fallen champion on the ChAoS plane, kill Andor Drakon
while wielding the TotRR, and instead become an Avatar of his current alignment, despite not
being crowned. This is one way around the corruption requirement for the Avatar of Balance
and UCG endings. However, the PC must be able to change alignment on the ChAoS plane while
fighting Andor Drakon, easier said than done.</p><p>

<a name="4.3.3"></a></p>
<h4>4.3.3 Avatar of Balance ending</h4>
To finish this ending the following requirements must be met: the PC enters the Chaos Gate as a
crowned N= Champion of Balance wearing the Crown and Medal of Chaos and wielding the TotRR. The
PC must not be intrinsically doomed or cursed other than due to wearing the Chaos artifacts. The
PC must be extremely corrupted (the game will inform you when the PC is extremely corrupted).
Kill Andor Drakon while wielding the TotRR. If the TotRR is not wielded when Andor Drakon dies,
the ChAoS energies released by his death overwhelm the PC, turning him into a miserable ChAoS
wretch. Avoid this. ;-).<p>

<a name="434"></a></p><h4>4.3.4 Ultimate Chaos God ending</h4>
To finish this ending the following requirements must be met: the PC enters the Chaos Gate as a
crowned C- Champion of Chaos wearing the Crown and Medal of Chaos and wielding the TotRR. The
PC must not be intrinsically doomed or cursed other than due to wearing the Chaos artifacts.
The PC must be extremely corrupted (the game will inform you when the PC is extremely corrupted).
Kill Andor Drakon while wielding the TotRR.<p>

<a name="4.3.5"></a></p>

<h3>5 Unresolved mysteries</h3>
<a name="5.1"></a>
<h4>5.1 Kherab's third quest and the reward</h4>
When your PC has done the first two quests for Kherab, the dwarven
artificer in Darkforge, he tells your character to "be patient,
in the near future more will have to be done". However, he will never assign the third
quest, even to experience level 50 characters who are ready to close
the Chaos Gate or attempt an ultra ending. From scanning the
executable, reference to a "spear of raw steel" has been found,
seemingly a third quest reward along with the Shield of Raw Steel and
Amulet of Raw Steel now available.
<pre>------------ spear of raw steel (+4, 4d10+8) [+4, +0] {Wi+4} ------------

Weight: 120s

When worn it modifies DV by +4 and PV by +0.

When used in melee combat it grants a +4 bonus to hit and causes 4d10+8
points of damage. When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and
causes 4d5+8 points of damage.

It modifies your willpower attribute by +4.
This weapon returns when thrown.
It contains the essence of Chaos and Corruption.
It is very good at scoring critical hits in melee.
It grants resistance to poison.
It grants resistance to shock attacks.
It grants immunity to acid.
</pre>

<a name="5.2"></a>
<h4>5.2 Scroll of Omnipotence</h4>
In the secret compartment of the High Mountain Village, there's a message
that reads:
<pre>"Dear Lubaf, I am sorry to disappoint you but you won't be able to find the
Scroll of Omnipotence in this place. I have hidden it more effectively.
You will need to find the red rooster at dawn. Then you'll encounter the final
challenge.

With passionate hate,
 Alhacrast, Overlord of Jak-Nagiur."
</pre>
This may be what Khelavaster refers to as the foolish legends that built up
around the quest for the crumpled scroll and the Trident of the Red Rooster.

Upon further examination of the executable, it seems the Scroll of Omnipotence could
only be read by champions of Order/Balance/Chaos:
<pre>You read the scroll of omnipotence

As you read the scroll you suddenly feel great power surging through your body.
You feel invincible and your abilities are increased by enourmous amounts!
Now you are a true champion of %s!

...ripped to pieces by trying to claim power not meant for %s..
Immediately you realize that this was a big mistake as you
are not prepared for the wave of power that suddenly floats your body. You
are ripped to pieces almost instantly!....
</pre>

<a name="5.3">
<h4>5.3 Red Rooster Inn</h4>
The Red Rooster Inn is mentioned in the executable and is probably a red
herring. It was thought in earlier versions of ADOM that the innkeeper
would produce the Trident of the Red Rooster in the Red Rooster Inn at
dawn.<p>

The executable contains the following texts:
</p><pre>You enter the Red Rooster Inn. It's completely empty...

You enter the Red Rooster Inn as the sun is just rising. Alganon, the innkeeper,
welcomes you with great joy and honors you for helping the ancient dwarf. As
a reward he grants you a long item wrapped in a sheet. He winks at you and
mumbles "Ye know what'ta do with dat, don't ye?". Due to some urgent business
Alganon then leaves.
</pre>

</a><a name="5.4"></a>
<h4>5.4 Volcano</h4>
There is a volcano mentioned in the executable, but no character has ever
found such a location. It may be a remnant left over from earlier development
of ADOM, possibly designed to be the location where the Chaos Orb of Elemental
Fire could be found prior to implementation of the Tower of Eternal Flames.
Deeper analysis shows a volcano is just an unimplemented dungeon feature.<p>

<a name="5.5"></a></p>
<h4>5.5 Weird Tome</h4>
The Ghost Librarian in the Library of Niltrias demands silence. In practice,
this means the PC must spend a certain amount of time in the Library without
speaking. Spellcasting is allowed. After spending 2000 turns
(well spent reading spellbooks) without speaking, upon <tt>C</tt>hatting
with her, she gives the PC the Weird Tome. She instructs the PC to deliver it to
the Mad Minstrel, who will in turn reward the PC with five cursed scrolls of
chaos resistance.<p>

The mystery about the book is the fact that nobody has managed to read it.</p><p>

Scanning the executable gives some further hints on successful reading of the tome:
</p><pre>... manage to decipher the secret.
It describes a means to find the scroll of omnipotence.
... have to %s to find it.
</pre>

Giving the tome to saved invisible Khelavaster in Terinyo results in:
<pre>Khelavaster, the invisible ancient sage, curiously looks at the uncursed
weird tome. "Huh? Oh, I have read that a long time ago. Pretty interesting."
Khelavaster, the invisible ancient sage, drops the uncursed weird tome.
</pre>

Giving the Weird Tome to Gaab'Baay, results in:
<pre>Gaab'Baay, the old crone, hastily accepts the uncursed weird tome.
Gaab'Baay, the old crone, examines the uncursed weird tome closely.
Gaab'Baay, the old crone, cackles: "Na, I don't need this." Gaab'Baay, the
old crone, drops the uncursed weird tome.
</pre>
Demented Ratling eats the tome. Andor Drakon is ignorant and refuses the tome
from "puny mortal". Other unique characters simply refuse the tome.<p>

See section <a href="#2.16.1">2.16.1</a> for
more details about the Ghost Librarian and the Weird Tome.</p><p>

deviating from the standard

[1] If there is gold lying on the ground on the level on which the PC is
currently located, it will occasionally generate a message "You sense the presence of gold", or
"You feel the urge to get rich really fast." if there is a Royal Vault on the level.</p><p>
[2] Cursed: 1/4 HP and -1d3+1 To, uncursed: 1/2 HP, blessed: full HP; amulet of life saving does not save your life if you
get killed by - collapsing dungeon (kicking stairs, you die with the amulet around your neck), old age (it
tries to save you but says your time has come and fails); corruption (though it's not really a death, instead
you are transformed into a little purple j); wearing insufficient equipment when entering the chaos gate
(AoLS disappears when you enter it); sacrificing yourself (god destroys your amulet if you try to cheat him/her
and then you are sacrificed - under certain circumstances your god forgives you and will let you continue but
without your amulet); getting sacrificed by a monster (you die with the amulet around your neck).</p><p>
[3] Banshee wail just causes 20d15 damage instead of instant death if this amulet is worn.</p><p>
[4] Uncursed halves the time required to receive one point of HP healed due to natural regeneration;
blessed reduces that time divided by eight; cursed does nothing.</p><p>
[5] In the wilderness, the effect is about +10/+5/-5 B/U/C. Blessed necklace also grants some sort of "vision"
to blind players - it allows the map to be drawn only one square around character; monsters are not visible.</p><p>

The amulets with a numerical modifier above are base value in g16p2. There are others available. The numerical modifier can
be {base value} +/- 3. Amulets of speed, however, are always (+3 spd). Extensive testing was done by wishing for amulets of
the cold heart, amulets of defense, and amulets of order. For the statisticians among the readers, the results are shown

Thanks to ToGu for contributing the odds of obtaining weapons with a prefix, suffix or both:</p><p>

Prefixes and suffixes are evenly distributed.<br>
4/6 of items have a chance to have a prefix/suffix.<br>
2/6 of items have a chance to have both a prefix and a suffix.</p><p>

The chance to actually get the prefix/suffix is then 1/(10-(LEVEL/10))</p><p>

For a L50 character this means:<br>
Prefix/suffix: (4/6)/(10-(50/10)) = 2/15 =  13.3333%<br>
Both: (2/6)/(10-(50/10))/(10-(50/10)) =  1/75 = 1.3333%</p><p>

For a L1 character this means:<br>
Prefix/suffix: (4/6)/(10-(1/10)) = 2/30 = 6.6667%<br>
Both: (2/6)/(10-(1/10))/(10-(1/10)) = 1/300 = 0.3333%</p><p>

Keys are used for opening Locked doors. They can be found randomly, or bought for the right price from
Skriek (<a href="#1.3.4">1.3.4</a>). All keys weigh 1s.</p><p>

Keys have a chance to disappear or break after being used. The base chance for this is 1/8/40 depending on
B/U/C status, +20 if the key is rusty. Let's call this number KS (key status). If KS &gt;= Luck*5+1d100, the key
is destroyed or broken (1/2 chance for each case). So blessed key with positive Luck roll will never degrade, with
neutral Luck only once in 100 cases.</p><p>

[1] Add 3 to the average if potion if blessed, substract 3 if cursed.</p><p>
[2] Blessed potion drunks for about 60 turns, uncursed 35, cursed
10 turns. While drunk, the PC gets about -3 DV, -5 speed, -1 to hit, and
+2 to melee damage. Cursed potion also blinds for short time.</p><p>
[3] Throw holy water to damage undead for 6d6, this also raises alignment.</p><p>
[4] Throw at rust monsters to permanently remove their rusting capability.</p><p>
[5] Cursed grants 1 casting if no previous knowledge.</p><p>
[6] So it is possible to have for example "rusty rustproof orcish spear".</p><p>

Most potions increase hunger level by 100 when drunk, exceptions are:
</p><ul><li>potion of poison: no satiation
</li><li>potion of booze, potion of carrot juice, potion of gain attributes,
potion of invisibility, potion of visibility, potion of water: 20 satiation
</li><li>potion of exchange: 500 satiation
</li><li>potion of balance: 1000 satiation
</li><li>potion of toughness, potion of potential toughness: 2000 satiation,
can be drunk even when Bloated
</li></ul><p>

Blessed potions give +25% more satiation, cursed -50%, +10% if Wolf birthsign,
-95% savegame cheating.</p><p>

All potions are made of glass. When used in melee or as a missile, potions do
(+0, 1d2) damage in addition to their normal effect. They are destroyed after
such attack.</p><p>

[1] Scrolls of defense and protection affect only the following worn items in this order: armor,
helmet, cloak, boots, gauntlets, girdle, bracers. Cursed SoD and SoP always decrease DV or PV by
one. Blessed SoD and SoP may increase items with low DV or PV by two or three points.</p><p>
[2] Raven borns get additional DL+5 and a more powerful ally on top of that.</p><p>
[3] As you know (see <a href="#0eb">0.14.11</a>) you can only dip 1 item into a potion of holy water
at a time if the item in question is 10s or heavier. So a stack of say,
20 waterproof blankets will need 20 potions to bless them all. This would
be quite a waste of holy water. This can be walked around by using
scrolls of repair. Cursed scroll will break the stack and a blessed one will repair it
AND improve B/U/C status by one rank. So a (cursed) stack of items,
regardless of size can first be broken with a cursed scroll of repair,
then repaired and blessed with a blessed scroll of repair. This is
very cheap considering scrolls of repair can be manipulated easily in
large stack using a combination of cursed scroll of uncursing (or unholy water) and holy
water (thanks Anh Tong for this tip).</p><p>
[4] Does not disappear after reading.</p><p>

All scrolls weigh 2s. All books and scrolls are made of paper. When used in melee or as a missile, scrolls do (+0, 1d1) damage.</p><p>

 chance to increase it by (1d20+100) * PreviousTotal/100.</p><p>

Gems are meant as means to carry wealth effectively - however it is not
too effective in ADOM.
Gems and crystals are made from crystal, worthless pieces are from
glass. Gems can be used with slings. The base damage value is
(+0, 1d1) rather than the (+0, 1d4) of a rock, but gems are lighter, and
 crystals of fire will create fireballs at their point of impact.</p><p>

[1] The PC, only females, must search and chat with neutral giant frog
(use Calm Monster, 10% chance for it to offer a kiss);
if the proper one is found, some appearance-enhancing items are given as
 a reward; if the frog is unproper (25% chance),
then -1 Ap and -1 Ch. Golden ball is not needed to do this quest;
however, something is set by dropping the golden ball into a pool.</p><p>

Abbr is the dungeon level displayed in the lower right corner of the
screen, DL is the danger level, tttn is the top trap type number. For
any Caverns of
Chaos levels the danger level equals the dungeon level and the top trap
type is equal to (level x 5) - 1. So, for example, on D:1 the trap that
you would
find in the top left hand corner of the screen, if you could get there
and make one, is an arrow trap (trap number 4). Within these lists the
ttt just increases
by 5 each time.</p><p>

[1] The DL of the Shortcut level/Ogre Cave may or may not vary with CoC level it corresponds to.</p><p>
[2] The DL of the SMC is roughly equal to the PC's level.</p><p>
[3] The DL of the ID is equal to the level of the ID divided by 3 up to a maximum of 45.</p><p>
[4] ChAoS' and Emperor Moloch's Lair corruption rate is special. See section <a href="#0.10.2.1">0.10.2.1</a> for details.</p><p>
[5] The false Minotaur levels have a danger level equal to the
equivalent real Minotaur level. ie between 27 and 31. Their ttt varies.
The progression of the table above does hold, but
since you can't tell one false level from another other than by ttt I
didn't think it was worth writing them down. There is space for 14 false
 Minotaur levels, but I've only seen 12
so far. If 12 is the maximum there are only 172 locations. (The
remaining two maze levels are optional, so there are between 172 and 174
 locations). See section
<a href="#2.14.1">2.14.1</a> for details.</p><p>

<h3>Appendix N - Wishing - suggestions and warnings</h3>
<hr size="2"><p>

The <a href="adomman-R.html#R2">ADOM Manual</a> provides basic introduction to Wishing.</p><p>

<a name="wobt"></a></p><h3><a name="wobt">Obtaining a wish</a></h3><a name="wobt">
There are five ways of obtaining a wish in Adom. Note that it is impossible to wish for any
of the first three items on the list, making wishing for wishes a fool's game. Wands of wishing
cannot be recharged by any known means. Casting the Wish spell always drains 10 points of a
random attribute. Getting a wish from a wand of wonder is safe, because the needed PP exceeding
the PC's available PP comes from some unknown source. The -10 drain still occurs though.<p>
</p><ul><li>a blessed ring of djinni summoning
</li><li>a wand of wishing
</li><li>the Wish spell, which can be learned from a Spellbook of wish, a
 potion of wonder, a wand of wonder, or certain class powers (eg. level
18 Bards)
</li><li>randomly from a wand of wonder
</li><li>randomly from a pool
</li></ul><p>

If there is no room for the djinni to appear, you rub the ring... but
you only hear a groaning voice "There's not enough room to appear!"
The ring is wasted.</p></a><p><a name="wobt">

</a><a name="wtop"></a></p><h3>What to wish for</h3>
<b>Items:</b> amulet of life saving if pre-Khelavaster, red dragon scale mails especially if pre-ToEF,
pairs of (guarantees plurality) seven league boots, scrolls of chaos resistance, magical writing sets,
eternium tower shields, potions of exchange, rings of slaying, rings of regeneration, wands of teleportation,
spellbooks of acid ball, bracers of resistance.<p>

<b>Skills:</b> Concentration for magic; Find Weakness for melee</p><p>

<b>Weapons:</b> phase daggers (if no penetrating weapons are found), boomerangs; in general weapons
are not a wise thing to use a wish on, there are plenty available in the game</p><p>

<a name="wdet"></a></p><h3>Details</h3>
Wishes can yield any skill except for Alertness (which, when wished
for, increases Perception) and Healing (which, when wished for, heals the
PC). Attributes can also be wished for - although, wishing for 'learning' yields
potions of learning - wish for 'knowledge' to increase Learning directly.
Appearance has to be wished for as 'beauty' and Perception as 'alertness'.
The size of the attribute increase depends on the attribute: St - 1d4+1, Le - 2d3,
Wi - 1d6+2, Dx - 2d2+1, To - 1d4+1, Ch - 3d3, Ap - 4d2, Ma - 1d4+1, Pe - 2d3.<p>

A "manual of bridge building" can be wished for and the PC is able to learn
the skill by reading it. Wishing for "manuals of bridge building" results
in the strange flux message then Nothing Happens.</p><p>

If the PC wants to increase Learning, wishing for crystals of knowledge
is better than wishing for potions of learning since blessed CoK's increase
Learning by 1d2, you get three with one wish, and you can bless multiple
CoK's with one potion of holy water, whereas you get two potions of learning,
both of which take a potion of holy water to bless. With any decent kind of
luck, the CoK's should bring at least 4, 5 or even 6 extra points to Learning.
However, CoKs will only raise Learning to about 25.</p><p>

Wishing for the plural form of certain items results in a message:</p><p>
</p><pre>A voice in your mind booms...
"*ONE* SHALL BE ENOUGH!"
Your equipment feels heavier.
</pre>
Items in this category include amulets of life saving, girdles of giant
strength, potions of gain attributes, whips of the snake, whips of slaughtering,
swords of sharpness. Potions of -attribute- can only be
obtained two at a time. Other wishes results in 2d2 items or stacks.<p>

Fish can only be wished for in its raw form, as "piece of fish meat" or "pieces of fish meat".
Wishing for fried fish gives regular fish instead.</p><p>

<a name="wspd"></a></p><h3>Wishing for speed</h3>
Stephen White has studied this in some detail and posted the following to RGRA on March 7th, 2002:<p>

</p><pre>First I will mention that during the following testing I was
careful to look out for things like base modification of
speed due to burden or hunger status - I was always not even
burdened, and always of no specific hunger status, i.e. not
satiated or hungry, just normal.

OK, I just tested this out. I wished for "potions of boost speed"
10 times. I got only two potions twice, three potions six times,
and four potions twice, so we can assume the average is three
per wish.

I blessed them all, and drank them one at a time, allowing my
speed to return to normal between each one. The lowest speed
boost given was 21 points, which occured three times. The
highest was 47, acheived just once. The average overall was
30.8 speed points from one blessed potion.

This gives an overall total (assuming three potions from an
average wish, and average gain from each) of 92.4 points.

Then I tried wishing for "speed" directly, 12 times. I let my
speed return to normal after each, and took account of the
permanent increase of 1 point left over after the boost wears
off. The minimum boost I received was 150 points, the maximum
was 248 points. The overall average was 214.2 points.

So, this is pretty conclusive - it's best to wish for "speed"
directly. It's <i>possible</i> to gain more by using potions, if
you get 4 from your wish, and a decent gain from each, compared
to a quite unlucky wish for "speed", but in general wishing
for speed directly is almost guaranteed to give the bigger
increase.
</pre><p>

The original context of the thread was in regard to techniques useful when fighting Andor Drakon. High
speed is also useful when fighting Srraxxarrakex, the Emperor Moloch, or other monsters the PC just doesn't
want to be hit by.</p><p>

In the following table, the game's direct response is [in square brackets].</p><p>

[2] Wishing for a raider lord and killing him before Tywat Pare assigns the quest results in no reward
from Tywat Pare, other than the 300 gold pieces for the corpse. Furthermore, he will not assign
the quest. If the PC gets the quest, wishes for a raider lord and kills him, Tywat Pare acknowledges
the kill and gives the usual reward.</p><p>

[3] Interestingly, wished-for ratling guardians are as immobile as those in the HMV and respond with the
same message about guarding the city when <tt>C</tt>hatted with.</p><p>

[4] Wished-for ancient karmic wyrms are confused. They are immobile, think they are Sharad-Waador
and ask the PC to "Stand on the stairs... then we'll talk."</p><p>

[5] A wished-for dwarven mystic always responds with the "Ye art doomed!" message and then disappears when
<tt>C</tt>hatted with. The PC is not in fact doomed. See section <a href="#3.5.4">3.5.4</a>.</p><p>

[6] If the PC has received the puppy quest from the Tiny Girl, wishing for a Cute Dog and delivering it to
her satisfies the quest requirement. If the PC has <i>not</i> received the quest, wishing for a Cute Dog
may well result in one that is hostile. This causes an amusing scenario, to say the least, in Terinyo.</p><p>

[7] Most of the wished-for uniques just work normally. Dwarven smith offers Smithing services for gold, even without
a forge. Dwarven weaponmaster offers training. Dwarven innkeeper offers a rumor and an ale for 1 gp. Grizzled gladiator
offers training in exchange for the Golden Gladius. Cloaked ratling sells keys. Ratling Dealer sells climbing sets.
Half-orc bouncers grunt: "Ask da boss." Old Barbarians and master thieves will usually be hostile - can be calmed down,
but won't offer their services.</p><p>

<h3>Appendix R - Not hard enough? - challenge games</h3>
<hr size="2"><p>

<a name="metalman"></a></p><h2>Metalman games</h2>

<h4>Eternium Man</h4>
A challenge game that has very simple rules. The PC must proceed
directly from the starting point to the Small Cave. Ideally no wilderness
encounters will occur along the way. The PC must stay in the Small Cave
until experience level 50 is achieved.<p>

The first example was completed by Barry Kearns who reported it November 18th,
2006. It was done with a Dwarven Bard (for the cave bear companion) who was born
under the Raven birthsign with pick pockets and food preservation. The
experience level of the PC was deliberately kept at a minimum so the cave bear
was able to kill enemies until the PC accumulated enough ingredients to start
a wish engine via the "gremlin bomb" technique, then kamikazeing ancient karmic
wyrms via amulet of life saving + wand of far slaying combo. It has since been
completed without a pet using similar strategy.</p><p>

</p><h4>Iron Man</h4>
The Ironman challenge is very, very difficult to complete. The PC must
travel from the starting point in the Drakalor Chain to the Infinite Dungeon
immediately. Stopping in Terinyo or anywhere else is not allowed. Wilderness
encounters on the way to the Infinite Dungeon are allowed in principle,
although ideally they should not occur.<p>

The PC enters the Infinite Dungeon immediately upon arriving at the
appropriate wilderness square. The PC must descend to the next level of
the Infinite Dungeon every time a down staircase is found. No delay is
allowed for any reason.</p><p>

The objective is to retrieve the Sceptre of Chaos from the SIL, return
to the surface and leave the Drakalor Chain. It is not necessary to kill
MaLaKaI to do this, although in practice it may be unavoidable.</p><p>

This challenge game has been successfully completed perhaps ten times
by various players.</p><p>

</p><h4>Lithium Man</h4>
Lithium is the simplest possible metal. The simplest possible ADOM game
would be to travel immediately to the CoC, visit the ToEF when necessary
and finish the game. No other locations can be visited.<p>

This challenge game has been completed about ten times by various players.</p><p>

</p><h4>Plutonium Man</h4>
Plutonium is the most complex metal that occurs naturally. One possible
version of the most complex ADOM game possible would be to kill at least
one of every monster in the game. This is impossible, since some monsters
are mutually exclusive, for instance Gaab'Baay vs Andor Drakon, Jharod and
Yrrigs vs Keethrax. So in practice the objective of this game would be to
kill as many different types of monsters as possible. Bear in mind that
some monsters are exceptionally rare, such as solars, ki-rins and eternium
golems and may have to be wished for. Finding and killing all great -color-
wyrms would also quite likely be a significant challenge.<p>

Rachel Walmsley came up with the idea for this challenge game and notes some
interesting consequences:
</p><ul><li>killing a Cute Dog and a Raider Lord and still going through the SMC
</li><li>having to take on more or less all the subquests available, including
the Minotaur Maze and the Pyramid (with their level restrictions)
</li><li>killing Andor Drakon (or Gaab'Baay), Filk, the Emperor Moloch, etc.
</li><li>killing at least one Eternal Guardian
</li><li>taking on the Demented Ratling after feeding him artifacts
</li><li>having to waste a RoDS on a djinni to kill
</li></ul><p>

It would probably be easiest to forfeit Andor Drakon, finish a normal game,
thus stopping background corruption, and finish the game with an unlimited
amount of time to accomplish the goal.</p><p>

There are undoubtedly other implications.</p><p>

Petri Sihvola shocked the entire ADOM community by completing the first
example of this challenge game on March 15th, 2002. ;-) His PC killed at
least one example of every monster available in the game with the exception
of Andor Drakon and Keethrax, which are mutually exclusive with Gaab'Baay
and Yrrigs + Jharod, respectively. Petri used the technique outlined above,
closing the chaos gate as soon as feasible, then finishing the game. Eleven
wishes for rare monsters were used which required a marathon session in the
blue dragon caves after the gate was closed. A total of 3802 ancient blue
dragons were killed.</p><p>

Markku Rikola posted a UCG Plutonium Man entry March 20th, 2002. The
monsters which escaped this PC were: Gaab'Baay (of course), Keethrax (the PC
chose to slay Yrrigs and Jharod), ancient karmic dragon, emperor lich, fairy
dragon, frost giant jarl, great black wyrm, great white wyrm, greater mimic
and small dwarf.</p><p>

</p><h4>Steel Man</h4>
Again, very simple. Enter the wilderness and do not leave it until the PC
is experience level 50 (optionally never eat the food the PC starts with).
Entering any game locations is not allowed. The first example of this
challenge game was posted January 20th, 2004 by Alex Pinachos. Extreme
tactics were required.<p>

</p><h4>Titanium Man</h4>
The objective here is to finish the game with the lowest experience level
character possible. The Chaos Gate must be closed. Trolls have an obvious
advantage, and should be considered separately for this challenge game.
Alex Pinachos completed the first example of this game on February 3rd, 2004,
with an "ordinary" Chaos God ending. The only monster the PC killed was
Andor Drakon, who is worth only one experience point. The PC ended the
game at experience level one, with 87 total experience points.<p>

</p><h4>Brimstone Man</h4>
Enter ToEF at level 1, retrieve the Chaos Orb of Elemental Fire and leave.
No other locations can be visited. There is a 'wuss' version, which allows
leaving the ToEF to single wilderness square. For added challenge, do not
use altars.
Gut scored a <a href="http://www.adom.de/forums/showthread.php/12070-Brimstone-victory-by-gutt">brimstone win</a> on October 2012.<p>

<a name="other_chalenge_games"></a></p><h2>Other challenge-man games</h2>

<h4>Pacifist Man</h4>
Win the game while killing as few monsters as possible. The total number
of kills in the kill list counts (the lower, the better).<p>

</p><h4>Ecological Balance Man</h4>
Win the game while avoiding to kill many monsters of the same type. The
maximum of all numbers in the kill list counts (the lower, the better).<p>

</p><h4>Mediocre Man</h4>
Win the game with low attribute values. The highest attribute value (as
displayed on the screen, i.e. including items, boosts and corruptions)
ever encountered during the game counts (the lower, the better).
Exception: If an attribute is raised by a corruption and that corruption is
removed on the turn after the character obtains it, the higher value
does not count.<p>

</p><h4>Archmage</h4>
An Archmage is a PC who is capable of bookcasting Wish indefinitely. This means that they
have to be able to sustain the PP cost of bookcasting, either with PP or HP, even as the
entirety of their attribute scores are reduced to 1. Commonly this is achieved by playing a
Wizard and reaching level 50, plus draining a couple of wands or drinking blessed PoUH from
Jharod. Great Book Caster is pretty much essential.<p>

It is the road to ultimate power, because once PCs are capable of casting Wish with all attributes
reduced to 1 (regenerating PP/HP afterwards), they can wish indefinitely provided they stay
in a spot inaccessible to enemy interference (such as the small island in Terinyo, which
apparently also regenerates PP quickly). Well, old age or running out of food could stop
them in theory, but... You can wish for potions of longevity and of course stomafillia herbs
(or elvish bread, or large rations - with infinite wishes it doesn't matter). Usually archmages
will use their infinite wishes for potions of -attribute-, weapon marks, spellbooks of all the spells
in the game, any item one could ever possibly want with the best possible attribute bonus (you
can wish for 100 girdles of giant strength and keep the one that has +16, for instance), and so
on and so forth, several thousand potions of ultra healing to slowly inflate HP score to
ridiculous amounts, 50 lumps of gelee royal to remove all the scars from corrupted tissue,
or whatever who cares.</p><p>

Eventually, the player exits Archmage mode, drinks all the potions and breezes through the
rest of the game, happily, with 99 in everything, all spells at 30000, Grand Mastery in
everything, every mundane item in the game, over 10k HP and PP and so on.</p><p>

<a name="restrict"></a></p><h3>Restricted Games</h3>
Players have completed the game with a variety of different restrictions,
for a challenge, to demonstrate that it is possible, or to point out a game
feature that they regard as abusable or flawed.<p>

Restricted games can involve almost anything: methods of attack, equipment
used and religious attitude among others. The game can be completed without
using the ratling traders as a food source. It can be completed without
using the food the PC starts with and never buying from Munxip. It can be
completed without eating any corpses. Never buy from shops. Kill every
shopkeeper. The list is infinite...</p><p>

</p><h3>Restricted attack games</h3>
The game has been completed using offensive attacks limited to: only magic,
only thrown rocks, only unarmed fighting and only kicking. A game has also
been completed where all missile and melee weapon skills were equally
developed.<p>

</p><h3>Restricted equipment games</h3>
<h4>Brass Man</h4>
Markku Rikola has completed the game with a PC who picked up no artifacts
other than the Chaos Orbs and never used them. The PC was crowned; sixteen
artifacts were generated during the entire game.<p>

Steven desJardins improved upon this: he completed a game (June 2002) in which
only the seven required artifacts (the si, Moon Sickle and the Chaos Orbs) and
Whirlwind (randomly generated in the Casino) were generated. The artifacts
were never used.</p><p>

</p><h4>Proton Man</h4>
Petri Sihvola has completed the game (December 2001) without ever
equipping any items. This means no armor can be worn, no missile or melee
weapons can be wielded, no tools can be equipped and no Chaos Orbs can be
used in the tool slot.<p>

</p><h4>Carbon Fiber Man</h4>
Malte Helmert has completed the game with the most severe equipment restriction
posssible - only 100s of inventory can be carried at any given time. This is
the ultimate restriction possible since the Chaos Orbs themselves weigh 100s.
This means the PC must be naked with no equipment or food when carrying a Chaos
Orb. It also means the Chaos Orbs located above the Casino, the Fire and Water
Orbs, must be brought past the Eternal Guardian one at a time without the Ring
of the High Kings. Since climbing sets weigh 180s, the Tomb of the High Kings,
the Rift and the Library are all inaccessible in this challenge game.<p>

Upon first consideration, this game might seem impossible due to food
considerations, but Malte reports that this was not a huge problem, although
there were a few tense moments. The PC, a Trollish Monk, was careful to maintain
high piety at all times in case of a food emergency. In addition, strategic
caches of food, SoCRs, holy water and an amulet of death ray resistance among
others were stored throughout the game, initially in Dwarftown then lower and
lower for the dive into the CoC.</p><p>

Malte reports the most significant problems in this challenge game were surviving
the early game then getting the two early orbs and the PC's equipment past a
hostile Eternal Guardian in stages.</p><p>

</p><h3>Restricted tactics games</h3>
<h4>Atheist Man</h4>
The Atheist challenge is one where the PC does not
acknowledge the existence of the gods, never asks for divine assistance and
never uses an altar for any reason. A successful completion of this challenge
game has been reported only once, by Griffin Knodle on April 14th, 2001. A
more restrictive variant involves denying the existence of holy water. Holy
(or unholy) water cannot be acknowledged or used for any reason. This challenge
has been completed first by Steven des Jardins on October 27th, 2001.
There is <a href="http://www.adom.de/forums/showthread.php/11617-First-Challenge-Game-Atheist-Priest">another</a>
atheist win from February 2012.<p>

</p><h4>Berserker Man</h4>
Barbarians are an obvious choice for this challenge: never change
Tactics from Berserk, and optionally never wear body armor. This challenge
game has been completed at least once with a Dwarven Barbarian. Note that the PC has
to be very careful during this challenge game. No messages
along the lines of "Do you really want to attack the -foo-" will be generated.
True Berserkers simply do not receive this message. Be very careful about moving into
a shopkeeper, for instance.<p>

<h3>Appendix S - Improved keymap</h3>
<hr size="2"><p>
<a href="adom.kbd">adom.kbd</a> - download the improved keymap for ADOM, and put it to your adom_dat folder (overwrite the old keymap)</p><p>
</p><hr size="2"><p>

In the improved keymap for ADOM, <tt>d</tt> key is used to display various things,
for example pressing <tt>dq</tt> will display current quests etc. Exception is the <tt>dd</tt> combination, which will not "display" anything, but is used for
"comfortable drop". The <tt>:</tt> key is not used here, but could still
 be used if you remember it. The catch is that everything is possible to
 perform using alphanumeric
keys, there is no need of pressing special keys, such as <tt>@</tt> (press <tt>dc</tt> instead). The keybindings are complete as of ADOM R57.</p><p>
